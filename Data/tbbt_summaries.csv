Leonard goes to Leslie Winkle, a fellow scientist who works at the university, to propose they go out on a date. After an experimental kiss, Leslie declines Leonard's offer.
After feeling shunned by both Penny and Leslie, Leonard feels even more depressed and starts listening to emo music while he considers buying a cat. Sheldon points out that Penny didn't actually reject him as he never asked her out, so Leonard goes to Penny's apartment to ask her out on date.

When Penny calls to see if the guys need anything from the supermarket, Sheldon tags along to buy more eggs for his experiments. Back at the apartment, Sheldon has moved on to his next grand idea: luminous fish night lights.
Concerned at his friend's behavior, Leonard calls Sheldon's mother. When Mary Cooper arrives, Sheldon has got a loom and has taken to weaving panchos.

Returning home, Leonard ponders whether Penny has feeling for him. After the string quartet practices in Leonard's apartment, Leslie seduces Leonard. Sheldon comes home to find a neck tie on Leonard's doorknob and, unable to decode out the meaning, asks for Penny's assistance with semiotics.

Sheldon doesn't want Leonard to present their work either, as he feels the quality of the research is largely down to him. Despite Sheldon's protestations, Leonard decides to present the research.
Penny comes over to help Leonard find a suit for the conference, though she is unimpressed by his wardrobe. Later, when Penny sees Sheldon in the hallway, she tries to talk to him about his disagreement with Leonard but only makes matters worse.

They are soon greeted by Penny, who tells them she landed a leading role in the musical Rent. When they are invited to see the show, Leonard concocts a lie about attending a physics symposium by Dr. Farman-Farmaian, to avoid telling Penny the truth: that he does not want to hear her sing.
Later that night, Sheldon wakes Leonard to tell him he's worried Leonard's lie is flimsy and that Penny will see through it. The next morning when Leonard wakes up, Sheldon informs him he has created a whole new lie that is un-unravelable: they can't attend Penny's show because they're hosting a drug intervention for Sheldon's cousin Leo down in Long Beach. Additionally, Penny has agreed to operate as if the original lie were true in order to avoid embarrassing Leonard, who only lied to protect Sheldon.
As Penny is about to leave for her performance, she stops by Leonard and Sheldon's apartment and mentions the ""symposium"" they're attending.

The university is trying to woo Dennis into completing his doctorate at Caltech. Their boss tells them to show Dennis Kim around the university, to Sheldon and Leonard give him a guided tour. Dennis points out an error in Sheldon's work and highlights that he won the prestigious Stephenson Award at a younger age than Sheldon, sending Sheldon into a funk.

He later decides to focus on a different research topic and tries to collaborate with Leonard, Raj and Howard, who each tell him to ""go away"". Feeling bad for their friend's loss of purpose, the rest of the guys devise a plan to eliminate Dennis Kim.
Dr. Gablehauser tells Sheldon that Dennis Kim will be joining the department and there will be a welcoming reception. Sheldon explains he has decided to change his field of focus and now aims to a build a ""Neuvo Jerusalem"" in the middle of the Mexican desert in a bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
At the welcoming party, the gang has succeeded in brining a lot of young women to the party by sending around an email declaring it ""bring your daughter to work"" day. Their plan looks set to fail, however, when Dennis Kim is too shy to talk to the girls. The guys try think of a way to overcome Dennis's shyness, but by the time Dr. Gablehauser calls Dennis up to give a speech, he's already decided to leave the party and go to the mall with one of the girls. Some time later, the guys see Dennis Kim with a group of teenagers, drinking and kissing in the park."

After the guys talk Sheldon into joining their team, he threatens to quit if they don't go with his idea of naming the team the Army Ants.
When the guys are practising for the contest, Sheldon doesn't give the others a look in when he answers every question himself and promotes himself to team captain. Later, Leonard brings Sheldon a Batman cookie jar as a consolation gift for being thrown off the team. Hurt by the guys' decision, Sheldon decides he will form his own team to take them on. In the university cafeteria, Leonard, Howard and Raj are searching for the fourth player their team needs. Leonard approaches Leslie Winkle, who initially rejects their offer until she learns they are going up against Sheldon.
On the day of the Physics Bowl, Sheldon arrives with his team, which he padded out with a janitor, a lunch-lady and either her butcher or her son.  The teams are neck and neck until the difficult final question. Leonard panics and gives the wrong answer, throwing the question to Sheldon who clearly does not know the answer either. Sheldon's Janitor team-mate, who explains he was a physicist in his native Russia, gives the correct answer but Sheldon refuses to let anybody but him provide the answer. Since Sheldon refuses to answer the question, Leonard's team (PMS) is crowned the winner."
114,"Leonard stumbles upon an internet auction for a miniature replica of the time machine from the classic sci-fi film The Time Machine. Expecting the auction to run into the thousands, Leonard bids $800 just so he could say he was a part of the auction. When Leonard wins the auction, he explains he doesn't actually have $800 to spare, so the guys agree to split it four ways. When the time machine arrives, the guys realize the auction was for the actual life-size time machine, not a miniature replica.
As the guys attempt to transport the time machine up the stairs to the apartment, Penny is rushing to work and needs to use the stairs. Since the time machine is blocking the stairway, Sheldon suggests Penny goes up to the roof and jumps across to the next building. Later that day, Penny storms into the apartment, angry that Sheldon's suggestion failed: Penny skinned her knee jumping across the roof, the staircase door was locked and she had to climb down the fire escape, and an Armenian family invited her in for lunch and tried to set her up with their son. Penny chides Leonard for his obsession with collecting toys and comics, which upsets Leonard.
Later that night, Leonard regrets buying the time machine and thinks about how could have handled things differently with Penny. The next day, Leonard is packing up his collectibles to sell, which Sheldon strongly disagrees with. Howard and Raj come by and try talk Leonard out of it.

After being creeped out by the guys' advances, Missy goes out with Penny to get their nails done. In a sneaky effort to try win over his sister, Leonard tells Sheldon he should be taking an interest in who Missy is with in order to protect her genetic lineage, which could one day produce another remarkable intellect like Sheldon's. Sheldon accepts Leonard's argument but instantly dismisses all three of the guys as unsuitable for his sister.
When Missy witnesses Sheldon telling the guys they're not good enough for her, she demands to see Sheldon in his room where she explains he does not have a say in who she dates. Sheldon informs the guys he no longer has any say in the matter, and they decide to vie for Missy's affection in a more restrained manner.

Penny tries to comfort Sheldon to no avail.

Over at Penny's, the pair are now throwing up together after drinking too much.
The next day, Raj and Sheldon argue over what to name the cricket they found. Howard and Raj prefer Toby, but Sheldon thinks that's a ridiculous name for a cricket. Howard brings an insect guide to determine the species, but he and Sheldon continue to argue. With their cricket debate still waging, the guys pay little attention to Leonard who wants to discuss his drunken night with Penny. The guys go to the university's entomologist, Professor Crawley, to get him to identify the cricket. After Crawley determines it's a field cricket, Sheldon concedes defeat to Howard.
As Sheldon gathers his collateral for the bet to hand over to Howard, Penny asks him about her relationship with Leonard. Sheldon says they shouldn't worry so much about their relationship as they can always return to being friends.

One of the ladies, Bethany, is getting a new tatoo while Howard and Raj watch on nervously.
As Howard looks through the tatoo catalog, he can't decide between a skull or Kermit the Frog.

After Howard and Raj reveal that they're not really Goths, the women leave them behind.
Back at the apartment, Sheldon asks that any amorous activities between Leonard & Penny be kept at an appropriate volume. Penny suggests to Leonard that he should go assemble the new bed in her apartment.

As Sheldon orders his dinner from Siam Palace, he hears Penny shouting from across the hall. Sheldon runs to her apartment and, after knocking on her door, is told to enter. Sheldon hears Penny calling from her bedroom and runs to her bedroom door, knocking again. Sheldon, after being told not to dare knock on her bathroom door, enters to find Penny in the bathtub.

When Penny arrives at the apartment, she wants to know why Howard hasn't called Bernadette after their last date.

Penny tells Sheldon she just wants to know more about Leonard's work. Sheldon says Leonard is researching sub-atomic particles and agrees to explain this to Penny, but this leads him right back to ancient Greece.

Sheldon has planned a treat for his mother the next day, taking her to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture. Mary would rather see of the local sights. Leonard suggests they take Mary to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame, while Penny suggests shopping on Rodeo Drive. The next morning, Sheldon apologizes for his behavior last night, but he still expects his mother to join him for the lecture. Mary says she will still be spending the day sightseeing with Sheldon's friends.
After a disappointing trip to the lecture alone, Sheldon goes to Amy's apartment in a foul mood. Amy suggests he's in a bad mood because his mother isn't making him the focus of her attention. Sheldon starts sneezing, leading Amy to suggest he's coming down with a cold. Meanwhile, the gang and Mary are in a Catholic church where she leads them in a prayer. Elsewhere, Sheldon is sitting on a park bench when a stranger sits down beside him. Sheldon compares his own brilliance to the common man sitting next to him. When it starts to rain, Sheldon notes how rain is another great equalizer, falling on the head of the brilliant and unremarkable alike - except when the common man has an umbrella.
Back in the apartment, Mary has made dinner for the rest of the gang. A soaking wet Sheldon enters in need to a tissue. When Mary realizes Sheldon is sick, she drops what she's doing and starts caring for him, putting him to bed. As Mary rubs VapoRub on Sheldon's chest, he's disappointed how they didn't get to spend much time together on her trip. Mary explains how they need to have a different relationship now he's a grown man, and then sings Soft Kitty to him."
507,"Sheldon is working late in his office, frustrated by the quality of his work so late in the day. After the power goes out, Sheldon ventures out of his office to hear a ghostly moan, a rattling of chains and a witch's cackle. A ghostly voice calls out his name and a bloody message appears on the Wall - ""See you in hell Sheldon"" - but the scariest part of that to Sheldon is the missing comma. A glowing skeleton rushes towards him, causing Sheldon a slight fright. Sheldon urges his merry pranksters to come out and take a bow. Raj and Howard try get Sheldon to admit he scared them, but he claims they would be unable to scare him as he's so much smarter. As we walks back into his office, Leonard appears in a Balok mask, causing Sheldon to scream and fall to the ground.
At the comic book store, Sheldon promises the guys that as a Texan he knows how to settle a score. An attractive woman walks into the comic book store. Stuart attempts to chat to her but fails. The girl approaches Leonard to ask if he's getting the rare Next Men comic, which he is. The girl asks if pretending to hit on him would let her steal it away, but Leonard cautions that she'd be using her powers for evil. The girl introduces herself as Alice and tells Leonard he's very cute. Alice asks if Leonard would be open to trading his magazine, so she gives him her number.
As Sheldon and Leonard arrive at the apartment building, Sheldon urges Leonard to check his mail. Penny arrives with more Halloween candy, telling Leonard it's a rough month when PMS and Halloween hit at the same time. Sheldon again urges Leonard to check the mail, which he does. Sheldon holds his fingers in his ears as Leonard opens his mail box, but nothing happens. Penny wonders what's wrong with Sheldon, but Leonard tells her to hang on. As Sheldon goes to inspect the mail box, a loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard's face pops out. Sheldon faints again, prompting Leonard to say ""You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.""
Leonard and Alice are on the couch in his apartment when Alice shows him a comic she draws. Alice asks to trade her own comic for the Hellboy issue, although Leonard says she can have his car. Elsewhere, Sheldon creeps into his and Raj's office carrying a box. Sheldon puts a snake into Raj's top drawer and waits for him to arrive. When Raj sits down at his desk, Sheldon pretends to be out of staples and asks him to open his drawer to get some. When Raj opens the drawer, he's anything but terrified and carries the snake away to get some mice from the biology lab.
Leonard goes to Penny's apartment to ask for advice on what he should do with Priya/Alice. Penny realizes Leonard is just looking for a way to sleep with both women without upsetting anybody. Leonard returns to the apartment to ask Sheldon's help. Sheldon quotes the German philosopher, Fredrich Nietzsche, who believed that morality was just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men. Though, as Sheldon points out, it's important to note he died of syphilis.
Sheldon goes to Howard's house with a hand buzzer and tries to get him to shake his hand. When Howard eventually shakes his hand, he gets shocked and clutches his heart, falling to the ground. Bernadette tells a shocked Sheldon that Howard has a heart condition and that they need to inject him with adrenaline. Bernadette says she's not strong enough to get through his chest plate, so Sheldon will have to deliver the injection. When Sheldon finally injects Howard, he wakes up and says ""Trick or treat, bubbeleh."" Sheldon wonders how he could be so stupid not to realize it's a ruse, slapping his hand on his forehead - forgetting about the hand buzzer he's still wearing.
At Alice's apartment, Leonard and Alice are kissing when he realizes he can't go through with this. He finally comes clean about having a girlfriend, causing her to be angry that he's just like all the other men. Leonard claims he is a good guy as he didn't go through with sex, missing the fact he led her on and ultimately still cheated on his girlfriend. Back home, Leonard video chats Priya to tell her about his misdemeanor. Priya is very understanding and admits she's cheated on him, though she actually did sleep with somebody else. Leonard is disappointed that not only has Priya cheated on him, he missed his chance as well. When Leonard ends the conversation, Sheldon jumps out of the couch cushions, proclaiming ""Bazinga, punk. Now we're even."""
508,"As the gang eats dinner in the apartment, the girls are excitedly talking about dresses for Howard and Bernadette's wedding. Sheldon is disappointed with the standard of discussion and attempts to change the subject. Fed up with Sheldon's objections, Penny suggests the girls go back to her apartment to look at bridal magazines. The next day, Amy stops by the university cafeteria having picked up a culture of prions for her research into Mad Cow Disease. When Howard mentions that Bernadette keeps texting him pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses, Amy is distraught to find out they went dress shopping without her.
Back at the apartment, Sheldon is concerned that he can't reach Amy. Leonard suggests they go over to her apartment to check if she's okay. When they arrive at her apartment, Amy is playing Everybody Hurts on the harp. Sheldon no longer wants to see her as she sounds weepy. Leonard tells him to step up and knocks on Amy's door for Sheldon, walking away afterwards. When Amy answers the door, she says she just wants to be alone. Sheldon asks if there's anything she wants to talk about - keeping in mind no is a perfectly viable answer. Amy says her world is crumbling around her because Penny and Bernadette went dress shopping without her. Amy tells Sheldon at this moment she is craving human intimacy and physical contact. Amy starts the bartering process with an offer of one wild night of torrid love making, while Sheldon counters with gently stroking her head and repeating ""Aw, who's a good Amy?"". Amy makes a final offer of cuddling, which Sheldon accepts, leading to the pair cuddling awkwardly.
The next day at the university cafeteria, Sheldon confronts Howard and Leonard, telling them to get their women in line over what they did to Amy. Back at the apartment, Leonard is serving the take out for Howard, Penny and Bernadette. When Penny notices Sheldon isn't there, Leonard says he had a late night, so he gave him an early dinner and put him to bed. Howard mentions Amy's sadness at their dress shopping with out her to Bernadette and Penny. Penny admits that she thinks Amy is getting a bit too crazy with her first time as a bridesmaid, while Bernadette says Amy keeps mentioning weird bridesmaid traditions which end up with them getting naked and washing each other.
Amy is dissecting a brain in her lab when Penny and Bernadette arrive to apologize. Penny offers to make it up to Amy by having a girl's night where they can do whatever she wants. Bernadette even mentions going to the Korean baths and washing each other - with loofah-mitts, no hands, Penny points out. Amy doesn't believe their apology and thinks they don't see her as a true friend. Back at the apartment, Sheldon is working on his Lego Death Star when the phone rings. Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot. Sheldon and Leonard go to pick her up - literally, as they carry her away to their car.
Amy is dissecting another brain in her lab and suffering the consequences of her drinking the previous night. Penny and Bernadette show up asking again for forgiveness. They were trying to find some way to show how much Amy means to them, so Bernadette offers her the role of Maid of Honor at her wedding. Amy is excited and instantly forgives them both."
509,"Penny returns home from work and runs into Leonard in the apartment building lobby. Penny invites Leonard to join her at the movies that night. Leonard is surprised by the offer as the pair haven't really hung out together alone since they broke up. As they reach Leonard's apartment, they hear Sheldon screaming. When they enter the apartment, they find Sheldon at the apartment window trying to shoo a bird away from the window ledge.
Later that evening, Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away by making cat noises. Leonard is getting ready for his evening with Penny and wonders whether he's dressed appropriately. Frustrated by his lack of success in shooing the bird away, Sheldon calls animal control to no avail. At the cinema, Leonard and Penny decide which movie they should see. Penny wants to see the new Jennifer Aniston movie, but Leonard would rather see a documentary about the building of a dam in South America. Leonard points out that when they were dating he always saw the movie Penny wanted to see and, since sex is no longer on the table, it's his turn to choose the movie.
Back at the apartment, Howard and Raj are there to watch Star Wars on Blu-ray with Sheldon. Howard and Raj are getting impatient for the movie to start, while Sheldon is attempting to make a high frequency tone generator to irritate the bird away. When Howard helps Sheldon finish the device, it doesn't annoy the bird - but it does shatter the apartment windows. At a bar, Penny and Leonard discuss the movie they just saw. Leonard decides to order fries but wants to make sure Penny isn't going to eat his half of his food despite saying she was fine, as she usually would on one of their dates. When Leonard presses her, Penny decides to get her own portion of fries - and Leonard charges her for it. Penny starts up a conversation with a geeky, hipster writer, Kevin, sitting behind her.
Back at the apartment, Sheldon decides to conquer his fears. Wearing a Baba Fett helmet and armed with a broom, Sheldon opens the window to literally shoo the bird away. The bird flies in and lands in Sheldon's spot on the couch. Back at the bar, Penny is recounting the great documentary she just saw to Kevin. Leonard feels Penny is only talking to Kevin because he said they're not on a date, but Penny says she finds him cute. Leonard decides he should go talk to a woman as well.
Amy and Bernadette arrive at the apartment to help Sheldon with his avian pest, but the microbiologist and neuroscientist struggle to see why Sheldon called on them in this situation. Bernadette lets the bird land on her, saying she thinks he's sweet and is probably somebody's pet. They convince Sheldon to pet the bird. Back at the bar, Leonard is talking to a woman, Laura, when Penny comes over, ready to hang out with Leonard again - now Kevin had to leave. When Laura mentions that Leonard had talked about Penny, she wonders what Leonard told her. Penny starts retaliating by revealing embarrassing secrets about Leonard to Laura, causing her to leave. Penny asks Leonard to take her home.
Sheldon has the bird on his arm and decides to call him Lovey-Dovey. Sheldon asks Bernadette to take a picture of him and the bird. When Sheldon goes to get the bird's nest so he can move it inside to his bedroom, the bird flies away. Leonard and Penny arrive back at the apartment building. Leonard apologizes to Penny for essentially calling her stupid and, this time, he's not just apologizing to have sex. Leonard wonders whether they're not quite ready to hang out as friends, but Penny says she was enjoying the more confident Leonard for a while. When Leonard gets back to the apartment, Sheldon says he's going to be a mommy, as he watches over a nest with an egg in it."
510,"Amy joins the guys when they visit Stuart's comic book store for New Comic Book Night. Amy is unimpressed that a brilliant man like Sheldon is interested in something as lame as comic books, and is equally unexcited when she notices that most of the comic books seem to depict women whose breasts could be used as flotation devices. Stuart approaches Leonard to ask him whether Amy is romantically attached to Sheldon, and then asks him to see whether Sheldon would be okay with him asking her out on a date.
Leonard approaches Sheldon to ask him about Stuart and Amy, though Sheldon doesn't even let Leonard get the question out without giving him some unwanted career advice. Sheldon isn't much concerned as he doesn't think Amy would be interested in an impoverished peddler of picture books like Stuart. Over at Penny's apartment, the girls are having a girls' night in when Amy receives a text from Stuart asking if she'd like to get coffee with him sometime. Bernadette wonders why Stuart's asking Amy out when she's with Sheldon, but Penny points out they've been ""together"" for a year and he's not her boyfriend, so it wouldn't hurt to look around.
Sheldon and Leonard go to Stuart's comic book store and find a young man, Dale, behind the counter. Leonard came to return his Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack, but Dale doesn't do returns. Sheldon is surprised to learn Stuart is currently out for coffee with a girl, Amy. Back at the apartment, the guys are playing Mystic Warlords of Ka'a. Leonard says they should go easy on Sheldon, since Amy's out with Stuart, but Sheldon dismisses their concern and says they're the ones who are obsessed with Amy and Stuart.
At the university cafeteria, Raj is showing off his deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack with signed and numbered collector's tin. Sheldon is browsing Facebook and has friended Stuart in an attempt to monitor his relationship with Amy. Sheldon goes to see Penny to ask if she would like to go on a date with him. Penny realizes Sheldon is just trying to make Amy jealous, though he denies this. Elsewhere, Stuart and Amy are enjoying a movie at the cinema when Sheldon interrupts to talk to Amy. In a bid to win her back, Sheldon offers Amy the chance to be boyfriend and girlfriend, so long as nothing changes whatsoever between them, physical or otherwise.
Later that night, Stuart is taking Amy home after their date. When Amy and Stuart say good night to each other, Sheldon shouts from inside her apartment to tell Stuart to take the hint. Amy wonders how Sheldon got into her apartment, while he worries this is the sort of nagging he can expect as her boyfriend. Sheldon has drawn up the Relationship Agreement, a 31 page document that enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of them both as boyfriend and girlfriend.
The girls are playing Twister in Penny's apartment when Sheldon arrives with a splinter, expecting his girlfriend Amy to sort it out. As detailed in Section 4 of the Relationship Agreement, ""Booboos and Ouchies"", Amy must take care of it."
511,"Leonard is surprised when an old classmate from highschool, Jimmy Speckerman, contacts him on Facebook asking to meet up. Speckerman was one of Leonard's high school bullies and he struggles to decide whether to take him up on his invitation. Leonard eventually decides to meet him so he can tell him everything he wanted to say to him in high school.
The guys go to a bar to support Leonard as he meets Speckerman. When Speckerman arrives he acts like they are old friends, reminiscing about their glory days in school, unaware of all the pain he caused Leonard. Speckerman reveals he contacted Leonard because of an idea he had to invent glasses that instantly turn movies into a 3D experience. Leonard doesn't think it would be possible. When Leonard doesn't mention the bullying, Sheldon tells Speckerman about all the horrible things he did to Leonard when he was younger. Speckerman thought they were just having fun. Meanwhile, when Penny, Amy and Bernadette discuss Leonard's decision to meet with his high school tormentor, the girls make Penny reconsider her own behavior in high school and how she might be somebody's Speckerman.
When Penny phones some of her old high school classmates to say sorry for her actions back then, nobody seems interested in her apologies. Amy suggests some charity work might make Penny feel better, so she decides to give away some of her old and unwanted clothes. Meanwhile, a drunk Jimmy Speckerman shows up at Leonard's apartment to apologize for his bullying of Leonard. Leonard accepts his apology and, noticing Speckerman should not be driving in his condition, invites him in for a cup of coffee.
The girls go to a clothing bank so Penny can donate her unwanted clothes to charity. When Penny spots a cute pair of jeans and a sweater somebody donated, her altruism comes to an end. The next morning, Speckerman wakes up and Leonard thanks him again for his apology, though Speckerman chastises Leonard for still harping on about that. When Speckerman helps himself to Leonard's french toast, he calls Leonard ""Nancy"". Leonard tells Speckerman to go, but he wants to finish Leonard's french toast first. When Leonard insists he go, Speckerman chases him and Sheldon down the stairs. Back at the clothes bank, Penny is searching the donations for a new yoga top, while Amy finds suede boots in Bernadette's size."
512,"Howard is demonstrating his magic tricks to Raj, Leonard and Sheldon, in their apartment as he prepares to perform a magic show for his cousin's birthday party. Although Raj is impressed, Sheldon is disappointed that his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret. Later, Sheldon and Amy are having date night at the Cheesecake Factory. When Amy tells Sheldon the exciting news that her recent paper made the cover of Neuron magazine, Sheldon doesn't pay her much attention. When Amy excuses herself to go wash up, Penny tells Sheldon that he needs to try be excited by the things that excite Amy.
Howard and Bernadette are practicing magic tricks in his bedroom. Bernadette says she might not be the best choice for a magician's assistant as she's uncomfortable with little kids. Howard suggests this will be good practice for when she's a mom. Back at the apartment, Sheldon is up late with women troubles and is drowning his sorrows, virtually, in Red Dead Redemption. Leonard suggests that Sheldon should listen to what's upsetting Amy and show her he can grow and change, but Sheldon is having none of that. Leonard then suggests he skip over any attempt to repair their emotional connect and instead win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
At the birthday party, Bernadette is assisting Howard as he performs his magic tricks for the children. When a child calls out that he knows how the trick is down, Bernadette yells at him to pipe down. Bernadette snaps at another child who suggests they're using a fake pitcher for the magic trick, and then tells him he won't be having cake after he calls out again. When Bernadette gives Howard the pitcher of milk to pour down his pants, she hands him the wrong pitcher and he ends up with milk all over his crotch. As they drive back from the party, Bernadette reaffirms how she doesn't like children.
Sheldon and Penny are at a jewelry store as he searches for a present for Amy. A pocket watch catches Sheldon's eyes, for him though - not Amy. Sheldon is dismissive when the shop assistant shows him diamonds, which he compares another carbon form: the charcoal briquettes which people toss on their barbecue. Back at the apartment, Howard is concerned that he might never become a dad and starts to wonder whether he and Bernadette are truly right for each other.
Sheldon is waiting for Amy in Penny's apartment, though Amy is unaware Sheldon will be there when she turns up. When Amy arrives, Penny tells her Sheldon wants to talk to her. Sheldon apologizes and congratulates her on her accomplishment, though Amy sees right through his koala face. Penny tells Amy that Sheldon bought her something, so he hands her the bag of jewelry. Amy is overjoyed by the tiara he bought her, though Sheldon now thinks it was too much.
Bernadette shows up at Howard's to talk to him about their having children. Bernadette realizes how important having kids is to Howard and tells him she's come up with a solution, that he be the stay at home parent when they have kids, which Howard reluctantly agrees to."
513,"As Sheldon and Leonard climb the stairs to their apartment, Leonard sees Penny's apartment door is open and observes her talking to Amy and Bernadette. Leonard walks over to Penny and asks her if she has plans for dinner tonight, just her and him on a date. Penny accepts Leonard's invitation. Meanwhile, Sheldon opens a package containing a life size Mr. Spock cardboard standee he ordered and is disappointed to find they sent Zachary Quinto instead of Leonard Nimoy.
Amy and Bernadette are with Penny tries on dresses for her date with Leonard. Penny tells the girls they're just going out for dinner and they'll see how it goes, insisting she's not going to make a big deal out of this. Penny admits she's nervous and that her and Leonard are only just now comfortable hanging out with each other again, and she worries the date could wreck that if it goes wrong. Meanwhile, Sheldon, Howard and Raj are playing The Settlers of Catan board game. Sheldon's inability to recognize the sexual innuendo as he describes the game is of great amusement to Raj and Howard. When Leonard gets ready for his date, the guys question why he's going on a date with Penny after the way she broke his heart last time around.
As Leonard and Penny have dinner at a restaurant, they agree to pretend they're actually on a first date to make it less awkward. As they ""introduce"" themselves, Penny admits she's glad they decided to do this. Leonard jumps the gun and asks if she thinks they're going to get back together. Penny tells him she will always have feelings for him, causing Leonard to point out how the word always makes that sentence worse. Penny says Leonard is over thinking this, like he always does. Penny says everything goes wrong when they talk and admits she once dated a guy for eight months without really talking to him.
Back at the apartment, the guys are still playing the board game. Sheldon continues to miss the double meanings as he describes his moves in the game. Leonard arrives home at eight thirty, leading Howard and Raj to deduce the date did not go well. Later that night, Leonard receives a text from Penny as he tries to sleep. Leonard walks to the apartment front door where Penny is waiting. Penny tells him not to over think this and leads him to her bedroom. After their amorous activities, Penny tells Leonard that she panicked when he started asking where their relationship was going. Penny admits she's worried if they go out, she might do something stupid and dump him again. Leonard has the idea of considering their relationship as like a new version of software, Leonard and Penny 2.0. They test it internally, shake out the bugs, and only roll it out publicly when they're both comfortable with it. They agree to pretend their date went badly to their friends. Penny hands Leonard an inhaler of his that she just remembered she kept.
As Leonard returns to his apartment, Sheldon is just coming out of the bathroom and notices Leonard. Leonard lies and says he needed the bathroom, noticed Sheldon was in there and instead went across the street to the gas station. When Sheldon questions Leonard's story and wonders whether Leonard took his inhaler, Leonard reveals the inhaler Penny just gave him back. Sheldon accepts Leonard's story as plausible, but then questions whether Leonard bought anything from the gas station before using their rest room, as is customary. Sheldon hands Leonard two dollars to go buy some beef jerky.
The gang are having dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. When Howard says he's surprised Leonard showed up after his bad date with Penny, he says they're both grown-ups and can still be friends. Penny comes over to take their orders when Howard slips in a jibe at Leonard and Penny's date. After Penny says sometimes these things just don't work out, Leonard butts in to say they'll always have feelings for each other. Penny is angry that Leonard won't let her always comment go. Penny says the reason they can't be together is Leonard always has to be right, and then excuses herself from waiting on their table.
That evening, Leonard receives another text from Penny, who wants to know why he was such a jerk that night at the restaurant. Leonard says he was just trying to act like they weren't seeing each other, but Penny thinks he was just acting like a tool bag. Leonard walks off to Penny's apartment, claiming sex after fighting is what they do now, and Penny follows. In Penny's bedroom, Leonard wonders why they're bothering with this relationship as every scenario he plays out in his head for them ends badly. Penny again says he's over thinking it.
Back in the apartment hallway, Sheldon interrupts Leonard's day dream to complain about being sent the wrong Mr. Spock. Leonard tells Sheldon that Zachary Quinto was pretty bad ass on Heroes, and then he walks over to Penny's apartment to ask her out on a date. Penny asks Leonard if he's thought this through and he says yes, and he thinks they should do it anyway. Meanwhile, Sheldon is unhappy with his Mr. Spock cardboard cut-out and decides Zachary Quinto is going back. In Penny's apartment, she's preparing for her date with Leonard when she slips into a day dream of her, heaving pregnant, marrying Leonard. Penny remembers to stop by the drug store before their date."
514,"Sheldon and Amy are filming a video in his apartment, the first episode of a new Internet series Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Leonard walks through the living room, interrupting their shoot. Leonard is heading out for his date with Penny. Later that night, Leonard and Penny are returning from their date. Penny tells him they should take things slow in their relationship, so Leonard suggests they think of their relationship like a software application that's being developed. They give their relationship a trial run and when they encounter problems, they file a bug report so they can fix it. Penny asks if he means a beta test, although Leonard quibbles and says it's technically an alpha test as a beta test is done by people who weren't involved in the development. Penny accepts Leonard's suggestion and they both agree to keep a list of any problems they have with their relationship. Leonard arrives home as Sheldon calls cut on take 47 of Fun with Flags.
Sheldon is discussing his ideas for Fun with Flags with Raj in their office when Howard stops by to see Raj's new phone. Raj tries out the voice recognition, Siri, on his new iPhone, with Howard saying he's finally found a woman he can talk to. Raj decides to get to know Siri and goes out for coffee. Later, Sheldon and Amy, and Leonard and Penny are watching Doctor Who in the apartment. Penny files a bug report that when Leonard asks her to spend time with him, he should plan something more exciting than watching TV. Leonard hands Penny a color-coded list of all the bugs he's found in their relationship. Elsewhere, Raj is talking to Siri and asks her to call him sexy.
In Sheldon and Raj's office, Barry Kripke arrives to tell them about a pot luck dinner they're throwing for Professor Rothman's retirement on Friday. When Raj asks Siri to remind him to make his famous popovers on Friday, Kripke says the voice recognition on Siri is terrible. Kripke demonstrates by asking Siwi to weccomend a westauwant, but she doesn't understand Bawwy's request. When Leonard picks Penny up for a date, she makes a point of noting all the changes she's made in response to Leonard's bug reports - such as reading more books and wearing less tall shoes. Penny then hands Leonard a list of her bug reports, including one that his eyebrows are stupid.
Raj is having Howard and Bernadette over for dinner and continues to be creepily attached to Siri. Bernadette isn't sure she wants to stay. Elsewhere, Leonard has taken Penny to a shooting range, having rang her dad to ask what Penny liked to do as a kid. Penny is impressed by Leonard's thoughtfulness and asks if he wants her to show him what to do with the gun. Leonard claims to know all about gats having played Grand Theft Auto, but he ends up shooting himself in the foot. Penny helps Leonard up the stairs to his apartment. Leonard claims to be bad ass for having a gunshot wound, but Penny says he's actually only got a Reebook with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on his pinkie toe. Leonard thanks Penny for hiding his Star Wars socks at the emergency room, and wonders whether it's time to evaluate their beta test. Penny tells him things are looking good. When Leonard arrives home, Sheldon and Amy are filming a Bavarian-inspired Fun with Flags.
Elsewhere, Raj arrives at the offices of Siri to finally talk to the woman of his dreams in person. Unfortunately he can only talk to his phone, not the attractive woman in front of him. A disappointed Raj wakes from his dream."
515,"Sheldon wakes Leonard up early in the morning for the three month emergency preparedness drill. Leonard is fed up of Sheldon's insane quarterly antics and wants to go back to sleep. Sheldon has Leonard pick a card detailing the apocalyptic event they will be simulating that night. Leonard picks the card for a 8.2 magnitude earthquake in Pasadena, so Sheldon forces him to put a heard hat and safety vest on and go stand outside the building, not before pushing him over for a ""hypothetical aftershock"".
Later that day in the university cafeteria, Howard is showing Raj and Leonard the press release detailing the space mission he will be a part of. Raj suggests Howard should get himself a cool astronaut nickname, but Howard thinks that the other astronauts have to pick it for him. When Leonard adds six sugars to his coffee, Howard figures out he must have endured another emergency drill. When Sheldon shows up to critique Leonard's performance last night, Leonard is too tired to deal with it and instead goes home to sleep. Sheldon tells Leonard he can't go home now as he has to take him to the dentist later that day. After Leonard says he won't be taking Sheldon to the dentist, Sheldon points out Leonard's obligation under Section 37B of the roommate agreement. Leonard says he's sick of the roommate agreement and decides to invoke Clause 209, suspending his friendship with Sheldon and stripping the roommate agreement down to its bare essentials.
In the guys' apartment, Howard excitedly tells the group that NASA has scheduled his orientation for next week. Sheldon arrives home, having taken the bus back from the dentist. Sheldon asks Amy to take him to the dentist tomorrow and is disappointed when his girlfriend doesn't cater to his every whim. Sheldon asks his friends for volunteers who will drive him to the dentist, the shoe shop, the dermatologist, allergist, podiatrist, and even Supercuts. Sheldon goes to the comic book store to see if Stuart, his ninth favorite person, will take him to the dentist. Stuart can't take Sheldon to the dentist as he's working and, more importantly, he doesn't want to.
Back at the apartment, Raj and Howard are discussing his potential astronaut nickname. Sheldon arrives home, not having made it to the dentist. Sheldon says he's found a company that will send a van round for a teeth cleaning, although they mostly cater to dogs. Leonard caves and says he will take Sheldon to the dentist, and he will reinstate the roommate agreement if Sheldon will admit he's a thirty-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own. Sheldon will admit nothing of the sort and instead decides to check whether the dog grooming service will also shampoo his hair and clip his nails.
Leonard is watching TV in his apartment when the power goes off. Penny comes over to the apartment to see that it wasn't just her power that went down, since she didn't exactly pay last month's electric bill. Sheldon comes into the living room to implement power-failure protocol, though Leonard won't benefit as he's no longer entitled to the full benefits of Sheldon's friendship. Penny says she's got some candles, but Sheldon would rather rely on the safer glow stick. Seeing Sheldon's little glow stick, Leonard gets out a glow stick of his own - a full-sized lightsaber. Leonard decides to go to Penny's apartment rather than sign Sheldon's roommate agreement again.
Over in Penny's apartment, she and Leonard are drinking wine and popping bubble wrap. Sheldon arrives to say he's making s'mores and offers Leonard some, if he'll sign reinstate the roommate agreement. Leonard refuses so Sheldon goes back to his apartment to make s'mores alone. Penny takes pity on Sheldon and encourages Leonard to go be with his roommate. Leonard proposes they go back to the way things were, but that Sheldon must start showing him some gratitude when he does something for him. Sheldon suggests they reinstate the roommate agreement and add a annual celebration of Leonard, in the vein of Mother's Day or Father's Day, called Leonard's Day. When the power comes back on, Penny arrives to say the building manager said the power only went out because somebody went down to the basement and pulled the main breaker switch. Sheldon says Leonard should be thankful to him, whoever he is, as without him there would be no Leonard's Day.
Raj is with Howard in his bedroom as he awaits a video conference with NASA. Howard sets his phone's ring tone to Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" and wants Raj to ring it while Howard speaks to Astronaut Mike Massimino, hoping to inspire his nick name. Right after Raj rings Howard's phone, Mrs. Wolowitz shouts Howard to say his Froot Loops are getting soggy. Mike Massimino hears this and gives Howard his astronaut nickname, Froot Loops."
516,"As the guys eat lunch in the university cafeteria, their boss, President Siebert, comes over to tell Sheldon he has to take a vacation, which Sheldon strongly disagrees with.

When Leonard meets Penny in the hallway on her way to do laundry, she reveals to him that Bernadette's dad wants Howard to sign a pre-nup.

In Amy's lab, Sheldon arrives ready to start his vacation. Unexpectedly for Sheldon, Amy wants him to do some grunt work and wash the beakers. Elsewhere, in the university cafeteria, Leonard tells Howard that he's heard Bernadette is thinking about asking for a pre-nup.

Penny scorns Sheldon for fainting at the sight of a little blood. Sheldon tries to prove he has a substantial wound but yet again faints when he sees it.
Sheldon returns to Amy's lab to try resume his vacation. Amy eventually coaxes a proper apology from Sheldon and allows him to continue working in the lab, cleaning beakers.

Penny's romantic evening for Leonard includes the best Top Ramen she's ever cooked and a trail of rose petals to her bed, where Penny presents Leonard a gift. It's a first edition of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which was Leonard's favorite book growing up and she remembered him saying how great it would be to have a first edition. After Leonard doesn't seem thrilled by her gift, he reveals that he did say that when they were at a used book store together, right before he bought the book.

When Raj says he's busy, Howard figures out he's going to girls' night. Leonard mentions he got an email from Professor Proton, asking him to take a look at a paper he wrote on nano-vacuum tubes. Sheldon finds it strange Arthur didn't contact him, so he checks his emails. He's disappointed to find two emails from Arthur, one asking for Leonard's email address and the other telling him he found it.

Leonard receives a text from Sheldon saying Bill Nye ditched him. Meanwhile, Raj has finally had enough of Howard intruding on girls' night.

When Arthur asks him for his opinion on his paper, Sheldon says it would be an honour - although he's already hacked his email account and read it.

Leonard apologizes to Sheldon and says he'll take care of it, if Sheldon will just stay calm about the matter. Later, Leonard tells Sheldon what it means for him to not freak out about the DVD. Sheldon tells him it's like an itch in his brain that he can't scratch, and that Leonard wouldn't joke about this if he could feel how Sheldon feels about these things.

Leonard arrives at Sheldon's office to let him the store owner died peacefully in his sleep, so there is no one to return the DVD to. With the issue resolved, Leonard takes the sweater off.

Eating dinner with Howard and Bernadette, Raj asks for their advice on how he should act when he sees Lucy the next day.

Back at the hotel bar, Penny wonders what's so great about being an adult.

Home in his apartment, Raj opens the note the vet gave him, finding it includes Yvette's phone number. Later, in the apartment, Leonard welcomes Sheldon home, asking him about his trip. Sheldon recounts how he made a new friend, kissed on Amy on the lips, and had the conductor play his banjo for him. When Leonard asks for more information, Sheldon tells him his friend's name was Eric, Amy's lips tasted like the brownie they had for desert, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger. Leonard asks Sheldon if all those things are equal to him. Sheldon ponders it, but thinks he would need to collect additional information - listening to other nine-fingered banjo players."

Sheldon is upset that after years of turning lump of clay Leonard into an acceptable conduit for his will, Penny has come along and reshaped him.

Standing outside Sheldon's bedroom door, Amy pushes Sheldon by saying she's not missing another prom and is going to go upstairs now. Sheldon opens the door to say he really did think Amy looked pretty, so much so that he started to panic. Amy reassures him that just because he thinks she looks pretty, it doesn't mean something has to happen. Sheldon asks whether she was hoping something would happen as its prom and Amy says she's always hoping, but tonight she just wants to have a nice time with him. When Sheldon thanks Amy for understanding, she begins to tell him something with the clear indication that he needn't feel pressured to say it back. Before Amy can get to her point, Sheldon says ""I love you, too."" Sheldon says there's no denying he has feelings for her that can't be explained in any other way.

Back at the party, Bernadette wants to leave now she knows what her co-workers think of her.
Sheldon and Amy finally complete the last episode of Fun with Flags. Back in Professor Abbot's office, the guys clear out the last of his files. Howard points out that not everybody will achieve great things in their life, so they should just be happy with the small moments - not that he has anything to worry about, after all he went to space.

When Bernadette starts crying and saying she wants to quit, Dan quickly says they'll still pay for her coffee - or better yet, get her an espresso machine.
When Leonard returns home late to the apartment, Sheldon is watching his laptop as the final episode of Fun with Flags has a total of zero comments. Sheldon feels all his work was for nought. Leonard feels the same way, having just cleared out somebody's entire life's work with no significant achievements. Just as Sheldon realizes that Leonard does understand how he feels, a comment comes through for the last Fun with Flags. Sheldon decides to bring back the series and opens up the fifty-year-old champagne to celebrate, even though he has no intention of drinking it."

When Penny insists they talk about the same things the guys do, Sheldon wonders whether that means they talk about whether werewolves can swim. Amy and Bernadette disagree on whether their half-canine status means they would be able to swim or not.
Sheldon's anxiety workout starts to interfere with Leonard's life when he is woken up by Sheldon playing a cacophony of ""scary"" sounds which includes Darth Vader, the Joker's laugh and Godzilla's roar. Later, Sheldon joins Amy for date night in her apartment, but he refuses to pay attention to her and continues working on his research. Amy is concerned that he's not been eating or sleeping and is obsessed with monitoring his anxiety levels. Elsewhere, Leonard and Penny, Howard and Bernadette are having dinner and playing another game of ""Emily or Cinnamon?"". Raj is upset to find them playing the game again and tells them it would really hurt Emily's feelings if she found out about the game. When Leonard recounts how Sheldon drank his first RedBull and vomited in his car today, Bernadette wonders whether they should make Sheldon stop tensing himself out.
Back at Amy's, she insists Sheldon take off the smelly cap he's wearing to measure his anxiety levels. When Sheldon refuses to comply, he finds himself taking the bus home after Amy throws him out. On his way back, Sheldon hallucinates that he's talking to an armadillo Isaac Newton. When Sheldon arrives home, Leonard and Penny march him to bed, tricking him into believing the ""President of Science"" is in his bedroom. When Sheldon refuses to be tricked into sleep, the pair sing him Soft Kitty and he finally falls asleep.
The next day at the cafeteria, Sheldon is now back to normal and says he's making progress with his research even without being anxious. When Raj and Emily join the gang for lunch, she questions them about the game they have been playing. Emily says that she finds it sexy that Raj is sweet and sensitive, to both her and his dog. Although she may reconsider when she kisses him and find a dog hair in his mouth."
814,"As Leonard and Penny discuss their day, Penny wants to know more about the work Leonard is doing with superfluids. When Leonard starts to explain his work to Penny, he has an exciting idea and rushes to tell Sheldon about his new theory. Sheldon believes there is merit to Leonard's idea. Later that night, Leonard wakes to find that Sheldon has stayed up late, writing a paper on their idea. Leonard is excited by Sheldon's paper and is soon convinced they should publish it online.
As the girls settle in for movie night in Penny's apartment, Amy and Bernadette want to watch the embarrassing ape movie Penny starred in. Penny doesn't want them to see the humiliating film but agrees to let them watch it. Elsewhere, Leonard and Sheldon are working the lab when Howard and Raj arrive to let them know their paper was mentioned on a scientific blog with lots of positive comments. When they find a negative comment from General Relativity, Sheldon wants to respond to the comment. Leonard doesn't think it's worth sinking to the troll's level, but is convinced they should respond after another taunting message from their critic.
Back at Penny's apartment, Amy and Bernadette are watching the ape movie as Penny browses the Internet for embarrassing moments from the girls' past. Penny finds a clip of Bernadette in a 1999 beauty pageant, singing a Spice Girls song. To get the spotlight off her, Bernadette reveals that Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself on the Internet. Amy doesn't want them to read her work as it's personal, though she denies it's about her and Sheldon. Her fan fic is about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with. Meanwhile, the guys return to the apartment and are anxiously awaiting a response from the online commenter. Raj is supporting Sheldon and Leonard by leaving positive comments from other user accounts, including Dr. Brian McDougall from Edinburgh University and Dr. Dimitri Plankovic of Moscow University.
Sheldon and Leonard's online foe finally leaves another comment, mocking their university and comparing them to engineers. An emboldened Sheldon no longer wants to hide from his bully and sends a message to the troll saying they will meet him face-to-face. When the troll attempts to start a video chat, Sheldon is scared and instantly closes his laptop. Elsewhere, as the girls read through Amy's story, they are captivated with the story of Amelia and Cooper.
Recognizing they made a real contribution to science while their troll only diminishes others' work, Sheldon and Leonard realize they have no reason to hide and decide to call their troll back. When they video chat with their online commenter, they are stunned to find it is Professor Stephen Hawking. They are relieved when Professor Hawking admits he liked their paper and was only having fun with his online attacks. Back in Penny's apartment, Amy has had enough of the girls making fun of her story and stops Penny from reading it. Penny admits she and Bernadette really do want to know what happens with Amelia and Cooper, so Amy starts to read the story for them.
Bernadette and Penny are engrossed in Amy's story when Leonard comes over to tell them what Professor Hawking said about his and Sheldon's paper. The girls shout for Leonard to leave them alone to continue the story. Later, Penny is reading Amy' story to Leonard, who finds it weird but still wants to hear what happens - until Amelia mentions physical love, at which point Leonard has had quite enough."
815,"As Sheldon and Amy eat in her lab, Barry Kripke shows up with a gift for Amy, to thank her for helping him with a research paper. Sheldon is angered to learn that Amy helped Kripke in the field of string theory, a subject he left behind as he thought it was unfruitful. Meanwhile, Howard talks to Mrs. Wolowitz, who's in Florida visiting family, on the phone. Mrs. Wolowitz asks Howard to check in on Stuart, who is finally about to re-open the comic book store.
In the building's laundry room, Sheldon tells Penny about his anger towards Amy. Penny assures him Amy didn't do it to make him angry, so he should probably just it go. Meanwhile, Leonard and Raj check out Stuart's store ahead of its reopening. When Howard and Bernadette arrive, Howard is angered to find Stuart has taken old furniture from Mrs. Wolowitz, who said he could use it. Leonard and Raj excuse themselves to go collect the food for the party, escaping from the tense environment in the store.
In Penny's apartment, Sheldon is still angry about Amy, so Penny works him through some exercises to relieve his anger. Sheldon struggles to let go of his anger, and reveals to Penny that Amy has been running experiments on her. Amy has been giving Penny trivial tasks to do, so she can monitor Penny's performance against chimpanzees. Penny is insulted and throws Sheldon out of the apartment. Meanwhile, Bernadette tries to calm Howard down at Stuart's store. She argues that some old furniture is a small price to pay for getting Stuart back on his feet and out of Mrs. Wolowitz's house. When Leonard and Raj arrive at the restaurant, they think they spot Castle and Firefly actor Nathan Fillion. They approach him to tell him how much they love his work. The customer tells them they must be mistaken, he isn't Nathan Fillion.
Amy arrives at the building to pick up Sheldon, but Penny accosts her in the hallway about her secret experiments. Amy tells Penny it's not a big deal as they run these sorts of tests on students all the time. Back at the deli, when Leonard and Raj apologize to the custom again on their way out, he admits he is actually Nathan Fillion and offers to take a photograph with them. Raj is now skeptical that the man is actually Nathan Fillion, but eventually agrees to have a picture taken with the man who looks like Nathan Fillion only more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is.
While Leonard and Penny are waiting at the comic book store, Penny fills Leonard in on Amy's secret exercises. Leonard realizes Amy and Sheldon have been running tests on him, too. Leonard and Penny accuse Sheldon and Amy of not caring about other people's feelings when they arrive at the store. When Howard arrives, still angry with Stuart, Sheldon tries to help him let it go. As Howard excuses himself to go answer a phone call, Penny and Amy are still squabbling. When Howard returns looking shaken up, he tells the guys his mother died in her sleep in Florida. The gang stop arguing and gather round t console Howard. Sheldon asks if he can say a few words, causing concern from Leonard and Penny who think he'll say something inappropriate. Sheldon tells Howard how when his father died, he had no friends to help him through it, but Howard does.
The gang, minus Howard and Bernadette who are traveling to Florida, gathers in the apartment, sharing their memories of Mrs. Wolowitz. Stuart is thankful for Mrs. Wolowitz taking him, while Raj remembers how she was so welcoming of him when he was new to the country and Howard was his only friend. Leonard proposes a toast to Mrs. Wolowitz, describing her as a mother to them all."
816,"As the gang eat dinner in the apartment, Amy mentions an experiment which aimed to see whether people could fall in love in a matter of hours by sharing intimate details and staring into each other's eyes. Sheldon thinks the research is nonsense, but his scientific curiosity leads him to volunteer to test it out. Penny, who is surprised that Sheldon would be comfortable opening up to somebody, offers to do it with him.
After Sheldon and Penny go to her apartment for the experiment, Raj is surprised Leonard and Amy are so calm about their partners testing whether they can fall in love with each other. Leonard offers to do the experiment with Amy, but her rude response to one of his answers puts an end to that. In search of something else to do, Raj, Amy and Leonard agree to meet up with Emily. Elsewhere, after landing in Los Angeles following Mrs. Wolowitz's funeral, Howard and Bernadette are horrified to find the airline may have lost the suitcase containing his mom's ashes.
After Leonard, Amy and Raj pick up Emily, she suggests they spend the night in an ""escape room"" where they must quickly complete a series of puzzles to escape a ""zombie"". Back at Penny's apartment, she and Sheldon continue the relationship test. After telling each other their ideal dinner date guest (Sheldon's being Sheldon and Penny's being Robert Downey, Jr.), they move on to describing their perfect day. They both notice each other's perfect day doesn't seem to include their partners, Leonard or Amy. Meanwhile, Howard is told that his missing suitcase did arrive in Los Angeles, but could now be anywhere in the world.
As they continue their relationship test, Penny tells Sheldon she wishes she could be as smart as the others are. Sheldon admits she has intelligence he is envious of, telling her how he struggles to read people properly and doesn't know when they're laughing with him or at him, or when they're having a bad day or they're mad at him. Penny says she wishes she could make things better for Sheldon. At the airport, Howard refuses to leave until they track down his mother's ashes. Howard reveals that he feels guilty for not driving his mom to the airport for her trip, telling her he was too busy. Seeing her husband upset, a scary Bernadette approaches the airline staff to insist they find the suitcase.
Leonard, Amy, Raj and Emily are disappointed that they completed the puzzles so quickly after spending $200 dollars to visit the escape room. Elsewhere, as Sheldon and Penny continue their test over some food, Penny asks Sheldon what he would regret not having said if he were to die today without being able to communicate with anyone. Sheldon tells her there would be something satisfying about dying on his birthday. Penny is surprised to learn it's Sheldon's birthday, which has remained a secret as he hates presents and surprise parties. Penny promises not to tell anyone about his secret.
Back at the airport, the airline has finally found Howard's suitcase. When Howard gets hold of his mother's urn, he apologizes to his mom for not driving her to the airport, promising he'll keep her close to him from now on. Meanwhile, after finishing their test, Sheldon and Penny try to stare into each other's eyes for four minutes. As they do, Penny asks Sheldon if he wants to stop as she knows he has trouble with eye contact. When Sheldon tells Penny he's comfortable around her, Penny says she feels he's like a younger brother to him. Penny is amazed it's been almost eight years since she first met Sheldon and Leonard, and she can't remember her life without them.
After the timer goes off and they stop gazing into each other's eyes, Sheldon and Penny both agree they are not in love following their experiment. After Penny walks Sheldon back to his apartment, he is taken by surprise as his friends jump out to wish him a happy birthday."
817,"As Leonard and Penny return to the apartment building after a session of Mini Golf, Leonard is extremely proud of his game, even though Penny won. When they return to the apartment, Sheldon and Amy tell them about the big decision they've made in their relationship: they're getting a pet turtle. Elsewhere, Emily tells Raj her roommate is away so he can finally stay over in her apartment. When Emily is called in to the hospital to check on a patient, she tells Raj to stay in her apartment.
At a pet store, Sheldon and Amy go to pick out a turtle. As Amy tells their prospective pet how he'll be living with Sheldon, except when he's at Comic-Con or on a work trip, Sheldon mentions he's applied for a one-way colonize Mars. Amy is angered to learn Sheldon has made a huge decision that could see him leave Earth forever without even discussing it with her. Back at the apartment, Leonard tells Penny he bought her a Valentine's Day gift but was too embarrassed to give it to her. When he explains he went to an adult store and bought a body paint kit and canvas, Penny is excited to try it out.
Bernadette is doing their taxes while Howard plays video games. Raj phones  Howard to tell him he's alone at Emily's. As Raj snoops around her bedroom, he accidentally breaks the door off one of her drawers and is freaked out that she'll know he was snooping. Elsewhere, as Leonard and Penny appraise their paintwork, they are disappointed to see that their canvas doesn't show much action. As they don't think of themselves as an old couple, they decide to do it again and make more of an impression.
When Sheldon and Amy return from the pet store without a turtle, Amy is still upset about Sheldon's unilateral decision to go to Mars. As Sheldon makes her tea, Amy asks him why he wants colonize another planet. Sheldon explains his scientific interest and shows her the video application he made for the project. Meanwhile, while Raj tries to fix the broken drawer with help from Howard on the phone, Emily returns home. Raj confesses to Emily that he was snooping around her bedroom, as Howard and Bernadette listen in on their argument over the phone.
Leonard and Penny are impressed with their canvas following their second go. Although Leonard wants to hang the painting somewhere, Penny is uncomfortable with what it represents, so she suggests they give it to Sheldon and claim William Shatner painted it. Back at the apartment, Amy decides to leave after telling Sheldon she thought them getting a turtle meant something but his decision to go to Mars shows it didn't. Sheldon follows after her, telling her getting a turtle meant a great deal to him, too. When Sheldon asks her if she wants him to withdraw his application, Amy tells him they should be planning their future together.
When Sheldon suggests he and Amy could go to Mars as a couple, Amy is intrigued. Sheldon tells her if he's going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim, he wants her there with him. Sheldon and Amy return to the apartment to fill out her application. Elsewhere, Raj thanks Emily for making up with him after their first argument as a couple. Before they fall asleep, Emily asks Raj if he snooped around her closet. When Raj says he didn't, Emily tells him not to worry about it, leaving Raj wide awake wondering what's in her closet."
818,"As Sheldon and Amy return to the apartment building, Sheldon checks his and Leonard's mail box and finds the issue of Scientific American which features an article on the paper he co-wrote with Leonard. When Amy reads through the article, she notices there is no mention of Leonard or his contribution to the paper. Sheldon doesn't initially see the problem, but Amy eventually convinces him it will hurt Leonard to have been overlooked. Elsewhere, Raj is with Howard and Bernadette as they drive to Mrs. Wolowitz to clear out some of her belongings.
In the apartment, Sheldon approaches Leonard to tell him about he was overlooked in the article. When Sheldon eventually spits it out, Leonard is upset to not have been cited, but is happy their paper is getting coverage nonetheless. After Sheldon presses the issue and tries to point out other overlooked contributions, Leonard gets increasingly angry. Meanwhile, Howard, Bernadette and Raj arrive at Mrs. Wolowitz's house, where Stuart is still staying. When Stuart tells Howard there's a power cut and it's going to be another day until the electricity is restored, Howard rushes to check on the freezer full of food his mom left. Howard is disappointed to find the last food his mother ever cooked is now defrosting. Howard decides they should eat the food and have a last family dinner at the house, where it will be like Mrs. Wolowitz is cooking for them one last time.
In Penny's apartment, Leonard tells her of his anger towards Sheldon. Penny doesn't really understand the importance of Scientific American, but offers to shop with Leonard to improve his spirits. Sheldon comes over to tell Leonard that he spoke to Scientific American, who said they printed his name only because they made an editorial decision to focus on the lead scientist. Leonard is even more incensed as it was originally his idea.
As Amy and Sheldon, and Penny and Leonard drive separately to Mrs. Wolowitz's house, tempers are still flared on both sides. Sheldon doesn't understand why Leonard is so upset with him as he wasn't responsible for what the magazine printed. Leonard is angry that Sheldon is willing to let everyone think he did all the work. Meanwhile, in the kitchen as Mrs. Wolowitz's, as they prepare to cook the food, Howard gets upset remembering how his mother used to cook for him and think her cooking could make everything better.
When Stuart welcomes Leonard and Penny to Mrs. Wolowitz's house, Penny remarks how pretty it is with the candlelight. Leonard ruins the mood by asking Stuart what will happen to him if Howard sells the house. When Sheldon and Amy arrive, things are still tense between him and Leonard. Penny and Amy tell the guys to behave themselves as it's an important night for Howard. Howard and Bernadette emerge from the kitchen to tell the guys not to think of this as a sad evening.
At the dining room table, as the guys discuss intellectual matters like an 18th century French salon, Leonard changes the topic to his and Sheldon's paper. As Sheldon and Leonard's bickering intensifies, Bernadette takes them both into the living room to yell at them. From the dining room, Howard hears for the first time how Bernadette sounds like Mrs. Wolowitz when she's angry, though the rest of the gang claim they can't hear it. Later that evening, everyone is slouched in the living room stuffed after eating all the leftover food. Sheldon and Leonard have finally stopped arguing, and Sheldon mentions that a new article in Physics Today did credit Leonard with the idea."

In the car on their way to Berkeley, Sheldon and Leonard play a physics game Sheldon invented, ""I Can't Spy"". The pair are excited to be giving a lecture about their paper. Meanwhile, Bernadette and Howard invite Penny, Raj and Amy over to help them sort through Mrs. Wolowitz's house for a garage sale. Howard is surprised to see Bernadette has stuck a price label on the Doctor Who TARDIS that he was planning on keeping.
Back in Leonard's car, he and Sheldon are listening to music when Leonard notes that they're making good time. When Sheldon worries about getting to hotel too early, they realize they will be passing by George Lucas's house. Although Leonard isn't as confident as Sheldon that they'll be able to meet Mr. Lucas, he decides it's worth driving by the house anyway just to see it in person. Elsewhere, Penny and Raj are playing ping pong when Amy wonders whether Howard has decided to sell the TARDIS. Howard wants to keep it but Bernadette wants it sold. Raj suggests they settle it with a game of ping pong, but Bernadette doesn't think that's fair as she didn't have a ping pong table growing up. Penny offers to play for Bernadette and, fearing he's outmatched, Raj offers to play for Howard.
When Sheldon and Leonard arrive at the gates of the Skywalker Ranch, they try to explain through the intercom system that they're just fans who were hoping to meet Mr. Lucas. When a voice on the other end announces the speaker isn't working, the pair are unexpectedly told to drive on. The guys arrive at a checkpoint where they explain their intentions to a security guard. The guard isn't able to let the guys in, but he offers to give them some Star Wars merchandise. After the guard leaves to get the merchandise, Sheldon runs out of the car and attempts to reach the property, only to be chased and tazered by security guards.
When Raj is winning the ping pong game for Howard, Bernadette tries to convince Raj to take the TARDIS for himself. Swayed by Bernadette's offer, Raj throws the game, so Howard replaces him with Amy.

In Amy's bedroom, Sheldon is in character as the Fourth Doctor, when Amy begins to regret winning the TARDIS."
820,"As Howard and Raj sit down to eat lunch in the cafeteria with Leonard, they are arguing about the correct pronunciation of the acronym ""GIF"". When Sheldon joins them, he is upset to have been left out of a physics symposium at one of Richard Feynman's former homes. Later, when Raj stops by Mrs. Wolowitz's old house with a house warming gift for Howard and Bernadette, Howard tells Raj he has received the title deed for the house from his estranged father. Howard's lawyers handled it so he didn't need to meet his father or learn any more about him. Meanwhile, Wil Wheaton is interviewing Penny in her apartment for his podcast.
On their date in the apartment, Amy is annoyed with Sheldon's attitude following his exclusion from the physics event. Amy points out that their relationship agreement doesn't permit them to be moody or to pout on date night. Elsewhere, Raj wonders how Bernadette plans to redecorate the house. When the door bell rings, Howard answers it to find Josh, who says he is Sam Wolowitz's son and that they're half-brothers.

After Bernadette sends Raj away, Howard confides in him that he just can't deal with this right now. When they return to Josh, Raj is ready to tell him to go away, until Josh shows an interest in Howard's career as an astronaut. Suddenly, Howard is more than happy to have Josh around. 
Leonard and Penny are having an argument live on Wil's podcast. Leonard tells Penny he's just trying to protect her from the disappointment her acting career brought her in the past. After Penny tells him he should be supportive when good things happen to her, he points out that he does support her in her ""decent paying"" pharmaceutical job.

Howard tells him it was only a mechanical hand and Josh say because that's all you need, leading Howard to remark that Josh is his brother.
When Leonard wonders where all this money Penny's making has gone, Penny tells him she has it invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, and that she has ""a guy"" to advise her. Leonard doesn't have a guy as he doesn't have any money. Penny wonders why it bothers Leonard so much that their roles have reversed somewhat, as they'll likely change again in time. Penny asks Leonard if it would make him feel better if she did something dumb, like sneak out of work to audition for a Kevin Smith movie. Leonard says that would be great, prompting Wil to ask him if it's fair to say Penny played him like a violin. Leonard says it is fair to say that.
As Sheldon and Amy debate the world's best forts in their own fort, which will surely win the contest, Amy's alarm goes off to remind her it's 10 o'clock, meaning date night's over. Sheldon proposes they suspend the date night parameters so Amy can stay later. Amy counters that she could stay really late and they could have their first sleepover. Sheldon agrees to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy/girl sleepover, though Amy tries to bid him up to a PG sleepover. When Sheldon asks her if she needs to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas, Amy tells him she's already hidden some throughout the apartment for just such an occasion.

When Leonard points out Sheldon spent a day with James Earl Jones without inviting the others, Sheldon realizes good things happen when he's in charge, so he takes command.

Over at Penny's apartment, Leonard shows off his sexy graduation gown for Penny. Afterwards, even though the school audience won't be able to see his legs over Skype, Leonard thinks it best to put on some pants. Meanwhile, Howard finally thinks he's found the problem with the helicopter. Now that Raj is back in the money, he doesn't care whether Howard can fix it or not. Howard explains it's not about the money but about the problem solving, which is why he became an engineer. When Bernadette arrives, she wonders why the guys don't just call tech support.

Back in the apartment, Beverly asks Mary what Sheldon was like as child. Mary tells her the story of how Sheldon tried to buy yellowcake uranium from a warlord in Chad. Feeling left out, Leonard asks Beverly to tell a story about his childhood, but her storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. Elsewhere, when Bernadette returns home after running errands, she finds Howard, Raj and Stuart lounging about. Bernadette tells them she's fed up of feeling like the mother of three lazy teenagers, and orders them to tidy up the kitchen.
As Sheldon shows Beverly a picture of his graduation, Penny arrives at the apartment. Fed up of the focus being on Sheldon, Leonard demands to talk to him alone. In Sheldon's room, Leonard tells him to stop hogging his mother's attention. Back in the living room, after Penny mentions she and Leonard haven't set a date for their wedding, Mary comments that they're already married in the eyes of God, eliciting an ""Ugh."" from Beverly. Insulted, Mary asks Beverly if the bible is ""ugh"" to her. Beverly apologizes, saying as a psychiatrist she recognizes how important superstitions can be to people. Mary objects the description of religious beliefs as ""superstitions"" and fires back a comment about Beverly's psychiatric books. When Sheldon and Leonard emerge arguing with each other, Sheldon says it isn't his fault if Beverly likes him more. Leonard tells Sheldon that Beverly likes everyone more than she likes him.
As Stuart and Raj help Howard tidy up the kitchen, they tell him it's a good thing that Bernadette is no longer babying him, like his mother used to. Howard realizes it's time for him to step up and be a man, starting with taking the garbage out. When the garbage splits as he carries it, he cries out to Bernadette that he's made a mess. Elsewhere, Sheldon and Beverly have a drink in a cafe. Beverly apologizes to Sheldon for upsetting his mother. Having seen a parenting style that is diametrically opposed to her own, and the prodigious offspring it produced in Sheldon, Beverly wonders about her parenting style. Sheldon points out that Mary's affectionate parenting also produced two ""mouth-breathing idiots"". Back at the apartment, Leonard and Penny talk to Mary. Mary apologizes to Leonard for the way she spoke to Beverly. Mary comforts Leonard that his mother loves him very much ""in her own cold, Godless way"". 
Bernadette congratulates the guys on cleaning the kitchen all by themselves. The guys are proud, until Howard's shoe and then sock stick to the floor. Back at the apartment, Beverly and Mary shake hands and agree to respect each other's beliefs. Before Leonard takes her back to her hotel, Beverly tells him there's something she needs to say. Beverly tells him she realized today there's more than one way to raise a child, therefore she would like to initiate a new protocol wherein she showers him with unconditional love. Beverly and Leonard then hug awkwardly. Back in Howard and Bernadette's kitchen, Howard, Raj and Stuart sing ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" as they continue to tidy up."

As Raj and Emily shop at Stuart's comic book store, Stuart prods them to hurry up as he wants to get home to Howard and Bernadette's where she's cooking meatloaf for dinner. When Emily finds a creepy decorative skull in the store, Raj is a little freaked out by her tastes but decides to buy it for her anyway.
When Leonard and Penny return home to the apartment, Sheldon asks them for their opinion why Amy's upset with him. Penny tries to explain to Sheldon why Amy is right to be angry with him, but he doesn't see it. Meanwhile, Raj joins Howard and Bernadette as they prepare dinner. Raj is creeped out by Emily's desire to have sex in a graveyard, so he's considering breaking up with her. Howard and Bernadette don't think Raj will break with up somebody who's sleeping with him.
As Sheldon, Penny and Leonard eat dinner in the apartment, Sheldon is still stirring about Amy, who hasn't spoken to him for twenty-four hours. Penny thinks Amy is right to feel upset that her and Sheldon's relationship is moving too slowly, but Sheldon doesn't see it that way.

Meanwhile, Raj and Emily are at a graveyard, where Raj struggles to feel comfortable.

After Raj denies this, Emily says if he wants to break up with her, he'll have to do it himself. Raj tells Emily he was trying to tell her he loves her.
As they drive to Vegas, Leonard and Penny are excited at the prospect of finally getting married. After Penny says they're getting married with no regrets, Leonard feels the need to tell Penny about a kiss between him and another woman during his North Sea expedition. Penny feels Leonard is only telling her about this to sabotage their night, but Leonard says he only did it to be truly honest. Penny thinks she can look past Leonard's indiscretion and they should still get married.
Back at the apartment, Amy video calls Sheldon. As Sheldon begins to tell Amy he's been thinking about their relationship, she interrupts Sheldon to tell him she needs a break from their relationship. Sheldon is shocked, but tells her he understands. After the call ends, Sheldon turns to the Gollum figure on his desk and asks him what to do about an engagement ring."
901,"In Vegas, Leonard and Penny choose their wedding package at the chapel. Sheldon calls Leonard to warn him not to get married, declaring that women are the worst following his break-up with Amy. When Penny phones Amy to check on her, Amy is surprised she wasn't invited to their wedding.
Sheldon surprises Amy as she comes out of her apartment. Sheldon feels that as it's been eleven hours since they spoke, Amy will have figured everything out by now. Amy tells him she will let him know when she's ready to talk. When Sheldon offers to walk with Amy to wherever she's going, he misconstrues this as a sign they're back together. After Amy admits she's going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch Leonard and Penny's wedding, Amy tells him he wasn't invited as they thought it would make things awkward.
Back in Vegas, Leonard and Penny are waiting for their wedding. Leonard asks Penny if she still wants to go ahead with it after his admission that he kissed another woman. Penny still wants to get married, but she would prefer if Leonard stopped bringing the kiss up. Meanwhile, at Howard and Bernadette's house, they comfort Amy over her recent split with Sheldon. As Howard sets up the TV so they can watch Leonard and Penny's wedding over the Internet, Bernadette is shocked to see Sheldon standing outside the window. Since the whole gang, including Stuart and Raj are there, Sheldon wonders why he wasn't invited.
In Vegas, the official talks Leonard and Penny through the procedure for their wedding. Leonard and Penny are excited that it's finally happening. Meanwhile, Sheldon and Amy's split causes an argument back at Howard and Bernadette's house. Soon, the guys are talking as Leonard and Penny's wedding takes place.
At the wedding chapel, the official asks Leonard and Penny if they have prepared vows. Leonard has but Penny hasn't. Penny tells Leonard to use his vows, while she'll make something mushy up on the spot. For his wedding vows, Leonard gives a romantic and scientific speech about how they're made of particles that have existed since the universe began. When it's Penny's turn, her speech draws on the song from Toy Story, ""You've Got a Friend in Me"", a film which Leonard loves. Elsewhere, Sheldon and Amy's bickering continues. Fed up with Sheldon's attitude, Amy says she doesn't need any more time, they're now broken up. As Bernadette goes to comfort Amy, Raj offers to drive Sheldon home. Only Howard and Stuart see Leonard and Penny's wedding stream live.
When Leonard and Penny reach their hotel room, Leonard just about manages to carry Penny across the treshhold. As they kiss on the bed, Penny seems distant and admits she's thinking about him kissing the other woman. As Leonard tries to explain how the kiss was meaningless, he reveals that he still sees the woman, Mandy, as she works at the university. Leonard tries to lighten the mood, but the romance has already gone.
Back at the apartment, Sheldon calls his mother in Texas. Sheldon asks Mary to stop praying for Amy, explaining that she broke up with him. Sheldon wants to return the ring, which Mary got from her grandmother, but she tells him to keep hold of it. Meanwhile, Howard and Bernadette try to cheer up Amy. Now that Amy's a single woman again, Stuart starts to be creepy around her.
When Leonard and Penny return to the apartment building that same evening, they're still fighting. After Penny admits she is not okay with Leonard's kiss, they go to separate apartments. Later, Sheldon goes over to Penny's apartment with a hot beverage to comfort her, after Leonard told him what happened. Sheldon and Penny talk about their problems with their partners.

Howard and Bernadette are worried about their friends' new marriage, but a creepy Stuart is more interested in Penny potentially being available again. Elsewhere, Sheldon tells Leonard why men are better than women. Leonard realizes he screwed up and can't believe he's spending his wedding night with Sheldon instead of his wife."
902,"After Sheldon goes to the kitchen in the middle of the night, he finds Leonard already up. Leonard explains he can't sleep because his wife is already not speaking to him after less than twenty-four hours of marriage. When Penny comes over to the apartment having been unable to sleep, she and Leonard wonder what they're going to do to patch things up. Sheldon suggests Penny makes things equal by kissing another person, like Leonard did. Now that he's single, Sheldon throws his hat into the ring, and soon he and Penny are making out. Leonard suddenly wakes up in his bedroom having been horrified by his dream.
When Sheldon video calls Amy, she explains she needs more time away from him to sort through her feelings. Sheldon claims to understand that they're broken up, but he reminds Amy about the ""baby"" they made together: Fun with Flags. Amy tells him she will not be coming over to film Fun with Flags now they're broken up, and Sheldon's tale of Sonny and Cher working together after their divorce does little to change her mind. Meanwhile, at the comic book store, Raj can't believe the news that Leonard made out with Mandy Chow. Even though the revelation is threatening Leonard's new marriage, Raj is more bothered by the fact Howard knew for two years and didn't tell him.
Sheldon goes to Amy's apartment with a box of her belongings, asking her to check through the box. When Amy finds a red bra among her property, Sheldon insinuates it could belong to any number of women now they're split up, though Amy recognizes it's Penny's bra. Elsewhere, at the Wolowitz house, Bernadette is angry with Howard for telling her about Leonard and Mandy, a secret she's had to keep for two years. Howard doesn't know why Bernadette's mad, so he apologizes for spending a lot of money on a George Clooney ""Manscaping"" kit.
Back at the apartment, Leonard calls a marriage counsellor to see how much a session costs, but it's more than he can afford. When Penny comes to talk to him, she apologizes for saying everything was okay before they got married. After Sheldon returns home, he suggests that Leonard introduce Penny to Mandy so she can see there's nothing for Penny to worry about. Leonard doesn't like the idea, which makes Penny even more uncomfortable with the idea that Leonard and Mandy see each other at work every day. Penny worries that even if Leonard doesn't have feelings for Mandy, perhaps she has them for him.
As Sheldon films an episode of Fun with Flags alone, he explains to his audience how Amy dumped him. Sheldon then moves onto the topic of the episode, which is countries that split up. Meanwhile, Leonard, Howard and Raj eat at the university cafeteria. When Leonard brings up how much marriage counselling costs, Howard already has an idea because he and Bernadette have occasionally gone to stay on top of their marriage. Raj is upset that Howard didn't tell him that he and Bernadette have been to counselling. When Mandy enters the cafeteria and sits down at another table, Raj and Howard made suggestive comments about how they find her attractive.
When Leonard goes over to talk to Mandy, she can barely remember their kiss during the North Sea expedition. After Leonard explains that he recently got married and had told his fiance about their kiss, Mandy posits that it sounds like he was trying to sabotage their relationship why dredging the kiss up from the past. Leonard admits that, on some level, he's always felt like he doesn't deserve a girl like Penny. Not taking the hint that Mandy isn't that interested in his personal problems, Leonard continues to sound off on his relationship with Penny. Elsewhere, Amy is furious when she watches Sheldon's latest episode of Fun with Flags, which features barely veiled references to their relationship split.
In her apartment, Leonard tells Penny he has something to say to her. Leonard admits that Penny might have been right when she told him he was trying to sabotage their relationship as they drove to Vegas to get married. Leonard says it's not too bad as he thinks he knows why he did that: he doesn't deserve Penny. She calls that a lame excuse but admits she gets it. Penny has the same worries that Leonard might one day leave her for someone more like himself. Leonard says they should stop being so scared and just be together. After a romantic and then cheesy speech about how he feels for Penny, Leonard gets down on one knee and asks her to stay married to him. Leonard and Penny go off to her bedroom to make their marriage official.
Back in the apartment, Leonard and Penny are surprised that Sheldon got them a wedding gift: plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco. Leonard and Penny think the trip sounds great, even if Sheldon is coming with them. A furious Amy arrives to demand Sheldon take the latest Fun with Flags down from the Internet. After Amy leaves, Sheldon comments that Amy watched the episode so he's going to get the girl back. From the other side of the door, Amy yells that she only watched it because he emailed it to her. Sheldon takes Amy listening through the door as a sign she wants him back."
903,"As Sheldon and Leonard eat in the kitchen, Leonard offers to give Sheldon a fun fact about mustard. Sheldon guesses Leonard's fact before he has a chance to say it. When Howard and Raj arrive, Leonard says they don't need to leave for the movies yet. Howard and Raj reveal that they're not going to the movies, instead they're ""kidnapping"" Leonard for a surprise bachelor party weekend. Leonard is excited and goes with them willingly, but Howard and Raj have to Sheldon up and carry him out of the building into the waiting van.
As they drive to their location, Sheldon is unhappy at being in the back of a creepy van. Howard explains that it's not just any van; it used to belong to noted physicist Richard Feynman. Sheldon's mood brightens as Howard explains that they're driving to Mexico to stay in the vacation house that Feynman bought with his Nobel prize money for a science-themed trip. Back in Penny's apartment, Bernadette wonders if Penny wants to celebrate her weekend by going to a strip club, but she's not interested. Even though they agreed not to make a fuss of the bachelorette party, Amy arrives with cookies in the shape of male genitals.
In the van, Sheldon is worried about Mexican customs and whether they're up-to-date on their inoculations. Back in Pasadena, Amy asks Penny how married life is treating her. Penny says it's good, though she's unhappy that Leonard hasn't worked up the courage to tell Sheldon he's living with her. After Bernadette wonders how Amy's handling being single, Amy admits she was thinking about changing her wardrobe. The girls are excited to hear that, though Amy says she decided against changing who is for some man. Still, Amy is interested in getting her ears pierced now she's no bound by Sheldon's relationship agreement, which forbids plastic surgery unless it's to look like a Klingon. When Penny offers to pierce Amy's ears there and then, Bernadette thinks the party has taken a weird turn.
Now in Mexico, Leonard tells Howard to slow down to avoid attracting the attention of the local police. Leonard is excited to be driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century, with the guys hoping some of Feynman's mojo will rub off on them. When there's a loud noise from the van, Howard thinks they've blown a tire, although Sheldon is worried the banditos are shooting at them. Meanwhile, Bernadette wonders why Amy hasn't updated her Facebook status to say she's no longer in a relationship. Amy realizes she should tell all her Facebook friends about her split, so she lets Penny know. When Bernadette asks Penny if she's updated her status to say she's married, Penny admits she hasn't even told her family yet. Penny says her dad always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding and she doesn't want to hurt his feelings.
Back in Mexico, the guys watch as Howard attempts to change the tire. He has managed to get four of the lug nuts off, but the last one is really stuck on there. Elsewhere, Penny finishes piercing Amy's ears. After Amy says her mother would lock her in the sin closet if she could see her now, Penny sees why Amy and her mom aren't that close. Bernadette thinks Amy would still tell her mother if she got married, annoying Penny who realizes Bernadette isn't going to let this go. After Penny decides to finally call her parents and let them know, Amy admits she hasn't told her mother that she broke up with Sheldon. Penny says she'll call her home now, but when she's done Amy is calling her mother.
When Penny calls her dad, she's surprised that he isn't angry that she got married without telling him. Wyatt tells Penny that if she's happy, he's happy for her. Wyatt goes on to admit that it's hard to tell someone something if you think it's gonna upset them, revealing that he accidentally killed Penny's pet pig about ten months earlier. Meanwhile, the four guys are all trying to unscrew the remaining lug nut to no avail. The guys realize that getting the lug nut off is nothing more than a physics problem. Following Archimedes' wise words, they set out to build a lever to help them - once they've decided on the proper pronunciation of lever.
Back in the apartment, Penny is angry with Bernadette and Amy for making her call her parents now that she knows her pig is dead. Penny insists that Amy call her mother and inform her of her break-up from Sheldon. As Amy makes the call, it's clear Amy isn't going to get to the news, so Penny grabs the phone from her. Penny not only tells Amy's mother about the break-up, but also the ear piercing and the penis cookies. Meanwhile, the guys' lever isn't helping so they look for another scientific solution. After an argument over which superhero would be best placed to solve this, the guys try to get the lug nut off with percussive shock, leading to a Queen sing-along. Next, they try thermal expansion by way of a tortilla chip. Then accelerated corrosion with burning salsa. Finally, they experiment with exothermic reaction with thermite created with rust and aluminium from the van. Soon, the van is completely alight.
When Penny leaves her apartment with a laundry basket, she runs into a rough looking Leonard and Sheldon arriving back home. As Leonard and Penny discuss the low points of their evenings, Penny accepts Leonard had it worse after he says he spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon."
904,"As they return to the apartment, Sheldon thanks Leonard and Penny for a wonderful day out at the container store. When Leonard and Penny take their newly bought stationery to her apartment, Sheldon wonders why Leonard wouldn't keep his boxes in their apartment. Penny admits that she and Leonard are now living together, causing Sheldon to accuse them of trying to butter him up with a nice day out before delivering their bad news. A hurt Sheldon storms off into his apartment.
At Howard and Bernadette's house, Sheldon talks to Bernadette, who was his seventh choice for a woman to talk to, about his living situation. Bernadette suggests that Sheldon view this as an opportunity to find a new roommate. Sheldon realizes he could find somebody better than Leonard, maybe even Chris Pratt. When Stuart comes down, Bernadette pitches Stuart as a new roommate to Sheldon, but Stuart is not receptive to the idea of living with Sheldon.
At the comic book store, Stuart asks Raj and Howard if they know any musicians who would be willing to perform at the store. Stuart hopes live music will give the place more of a ""staying in business"" vibe. As Howard and Raj have always talked about playing together, Raj mentions they could play ""filk"" music, which is folk music with a sci-fi/fantasy theme. Stuart is onboard with their idea since it sounds like the sort of thing he shouldn't be expected to pay for.
Back at the apartment, Sheldon gets Leonard to sign a new document bringing their Roommate Agreement to an end. Penny is proud of Sheldon for handling the change so well. When Leonard struggles to sign the document and end their time living together, a timely dose of condescension from Sheldon is enough to motivate Leonard to add his signature. Meanwhile, Raj and Howard work on their ""filk"" song in Raj's apartment. Raj has an idea for a song called ""Hammer & Whip: The Untold Story of Thor vs. Indiana Jones"". Raj plays guitar while Howard plays the keyboards for the song, the hook of which is ""Thor and Dr. Jones"".
As Sheldon interviews potential roommates, he struggles to find a tolerable candidate among a humorless chemist, a guy with a body odor problem, and a man who has band-aid on his arm. When Sheldon does settle on the perfect candidate, Amy, she tells him via video chat that she has no interest in being his roommate. Sheldon asks Amy what happened to him. He used to be completely disengaged from his feelings, but then Leonard, Penny and Amy poisoned him with emotions. Over in Penny's apartment, she and Leonard debate where to go to dinner. Their options are wide open now Leonard is no longer bound by Sheldon's schedule, but in the end they end up choosing Thai food just like Sheldon proscribes on Mondays.
In the apartment building lobby, Leonard and Penny ask Sheldon if he would like to join them for dinner. Sheldon explains that as he has become too emotionally vulnerable, he is reverting to his last stable version, which was the day before he met Leonard back in 2003. Later, at the Thai restaurant, Penny wonders if Leonard is doing okay since he looks down. Leonard admits he is worrying about Sheldon. Penny thinks they're doing the right thing by moving Leonard out and she is condifent Sheldon will be fine. Meanwhile, Amy and Bernadette have drinks at a bar. Bernadette can't believe that Sheldon asked Amy to be his roommate. Bernadette tries to pawn Stuart off on Amy, suggesting she might have a ""pasty weirdo-shaped hole"" in her life, leading Amy to defend Sheldon against the accusation he's a weirdo.
When Leonard and Penny arrive back at Sheldon's apartment, they find Sheldon sitting on a garden chair in a living room now devoid of much of its furniture. Sheldon has emptied the room to make it like it was back in 2003, before Leonard moved in. Leonard accuses Sheldon of doing this to get their attention and sympathy, but Sheldon says he's only trying to figure out how to live now that everybody is abandoning him. Meanwhile, Raj plays his and Howard's song for Emily, who is not impressed. Later, at Howard's house, Raj isn't so keen on the song any more, saying it has no groove. When Howard realizes that Raj played the song for Emily, he thinks she's breaking up the band. As Howard and Raj argue about the music, they both decide to quit. After storming out of the house, Raj quickly runs back to make things up with Howard.
Back in the apartment, Leonard tells Sheldon that him moving in with Penny isn't such a big change. Sheldon doesn't agree and is worried that it's just the first step in them no longer being friends. Seeing how much this is hurting Sheldon, Penny tells him they don't need to rush and can keep things just the way they are, for now. Hearing that Leonard will now be sticking around, Sheldon goes to write up a new version of the Roommate Agreement.
At the comic book store, Raj and Howard perform their song for the gang and a group of customers. The gang do not seem too impressed by their friends' song. Once Howard and Raj's performance is over, Stuart calls for them to play a song people can dance to."
905,"When Sheldon, Leonard and Raj go to Howard's lab to see if he's ready to go to lunch, they find him working on a impressive rotary device. Rather than a critical component for the space station, Howard is actually working on an appliance to trick his Fitbit, which Bernadette bought to track his health, into believing he's working out. As the guys admit their lack of exercise, Leonard says it wouldn't be a bad thing if the guys were more active.
As they eat dinner back in the apartment, Sheldon and Leonard are looking through a list of activities the university provides. Penny isn't sure that sports are for them, especially since Leonard even managed to injure himself during a Scrabble game. Leonard reads that Barry Kripke has started a fencing club. Sheldon and Leonard are drawn to fencing because it's indoors, doesn't involve throwing, catching or running, and there are no gym shorts that can be pulled down - or up.
The girls go to Stuart's comic book store to help him figure out why he's struggling to attract female shoppers, even though comics are more popular than ever with women. Stuart explains his failed initiatives to attract female customers, which included more women-oriented titles, folding the end of the toilet paper into a triangle, and a new breastfeeding area in the store. Amy takes Stuart to task for some of the artwork that could be demeaning to women.
As the guys, who are wearing fencing uniforms, practice with their swords in the school gym, their coach, Barry Kripke, arrives. Kripke warns them that this is a serious sport so they will be disappointed if they only came because they thought it would be like Star Wars. As Barry teaches them the techniques and positions, the guys grow impatient that they're not fighting eachother with their swords yet. When Barry takes a phone call during the class, the guys start battling eachother behind his back.
Back at the comic book store, Amy asks whether Stuart has ever thought about advertising directly to women, but his idea for a sign looks like a non-starter. Penny starts reading Internet reviews of the store from female shoppers who all found Stuart creepy.
The guys are starting to get the hang of fencing as they play practice matches against each other. As Howard and Raj fence, they both quote Inigo Montoya's famous line from The Princess Bride. When Howard complains that Raj was supposed to be Puss in Boots, he starts quoting Inigo's line as Puss in Boots. When Sheldon and Leonard go head to head, Leonard expresses his happiness that the fencing is taking Sheldon's mind of Amy. When Kripke wonders what's up with Amy, Sheldon admits that they split up. Much to Sheldon's discomfort, Barry shows an interest in Amy now that she's single.
After Leonard warns Kripke that it wouldn't be a good idea to ask Amy out, Sheldon goes over to Barry to warn him in his own crazy way: by demanding a duel. Since Sheldon has only had one lesson from Kripke, Sheldon suggests that they hold the duel in three years' time. Elsewhere, Stuart is ready to admit he is the reason his store can't attract female clientele. Stuart admits that the longer he is alone, the more desperate he becomes. Amy can relate to how Stuart feels, since she was alone for so long before she met Sheldon. Stuart once again misreads the situation and thinks Amy is asking him out.
The guys sit down for drinks at a sports bar, which Sheldon suggested as they're athletes now. When Sheldon admits he belongs in a bar because he's got female problems, Howard wonders if it isn't time for Sheldon to consider dating somebody else. Sheldon thinks it's a preposterous idea, but Raj points out that Sheldon never thought he would be in a relationship until he met Amy. Sheldon isn't sure there is anybody out there for him, since Penny is married to Leonard, Bernadette is married to Howard, and Emily has red hair and white skin which could upset Sheldon's fear of clowns. After Sheldon goes over to a table of women, he tries to ask one of them out with a Pokemon reference which she doesn't understand. Sheldon then turns his attention the woman's grandmother, who thinks she's too old for him. Finally, Sheldon ignores the red-headed woman at the table.
When the girls arrive back at Penny's apartment, Amy admits she didn't feel good turning Stuart down. The girls insist she'll get better at it over time. Amy then checks her phone and finds a message from Barry Kripke asking her out. Amy admits she isn't sure what to do. She thought she would date again but not right away, and when she did she thought it would be somebody less like Sheldon. After Bernadette wonders if Amy feels any attraction towards Stuart, Amy says she's not sure. Penny suggests Amy imagine Kripke naked to see if there's any attraction, but Amy doesn't need to imagine as Barry included a nude picture with the text.
When Sheldon and Leonard return to the apartment building, they run into Amy and Bernadette in the hallway. Leonard and Bernadette leave Sheldon and Amy alone to talk. Sheldon tells Amy that he tried fencing and found it pretty easy, perhaps because of his background in ""mathletics"". Sheldon then warns Amy that Barry Kripke expressed an interest in her, prompting Amy to tell Sheldon he already text her. Amy informs Sheldon she turned Kripke down. Sheldon then reveals that he asked two women out earlier in the night and they both turned him down. After Amy says she didn't realize Sheldon was interested in dating, Sheldon says he was told it's a good way to move on. After Amy tells Sheldon he looks good, he walks away and climbs the stairs to his apartment.
In Howard and Bernadette's kitchen, Bernadette wonders why Howard's Fitbit is reporting that he ran 174 miles the day before."
906,"Sheldon goes to Leonard’s lab with terrible news. A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop their super-fluid vortex experiment. Sheldon thinks they need to perform the experiment immediately, but Leonard reminds him they need helium and it’s on backorder for a month. When go to Kripke to see if the department has any helium in reserve, he says there’s a shortage and he needs it for his experiment.
When all the guys return to Leonard’s lab, Raj wonders why they need to rely on Kripke for helium and can’t just get it from party stores. After Sheldon admits he’s worried that the Swedish team will beat them, Howard says he knows a guy who can get them liquid helium if they don’t ask too many questions. Elsewhere, Penny sits down for coffee with Bernadette in her living room. Bernadette mentions that Stuart went on a date the other evening after using a dating app on his phone. After Penny wonders whether they could get Amy on it, Stuart comes to show them the dating app.
In the apartment, Leonard tells Sheldon he just heard back from the liquid helium guy. He has what they need and can meet them tonight. After Sheldon reminds Leonard he doesn’t like buying things at night, Leonard asks if he wants the helium or not. Sheldon does want the helium so they can stop the Swedes scooping them, but he worries this is highly unethical behavior. Leonard argues they’re only bending the rules a little as they have grant money to do the experiment and they can just spend it on the helium. Sheldon is afraid of violating the university’s code, so Leonard reels off an Eistein quote about the pursuit of science calling people to ignore the rules set out by man. Sheldon reluctantly agrees, although he struggles to find the Einstein quote online.
When a reluctant Amy joins Bernadette, Penny and Stuart in Bernie’s living room, Stuart puts the app on her phone. Penny starts swiping through potential partners for Amy. When Howard and Raj arrive back and ask what they’re up to. Raj thinks it’s fun and starts looking through the guys on the app.
When Leonard and Sheldon arrive at a parking structure in a rental truck, they see a guy standing by a nondescript, white-panel van. They step out and talk to the guy, with Leonard introducing himself and Sheldon lying about his identity. After the guy asks if they have the cash, Sheldon worries he’ll take their money and drive away. In turn, the guy worries they’ll take the helium and drive away without paying. When they appear to be at a stalemate, they start debating the meaning of the term “Mexican standoff”. Sheldon explains how the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away without harm. Sheldon demonstrates by telling the guy he knows who he is and where he works, so he could threaten to turn him into authorities if he doesn’t hand over the helium. After the guy reminds them he knows where they work and threatens to pound them into the ground if they report him. Now they really are in a Mexican standoff.
Leonard tells them to calm down as nobody wants to report anyone. The guy tells them he’s out. Leonard explains their predicament to the guy, explaining how the Swedes are trying to jump them on their hypothesis. The guy sympathises with their situation and agrees to give them the helium. Meanwhile, back at Howard and Bernadette’s, the group are drinking and eating snacks as they thumb through the potential suitors for Amy, who sits on in silence. After Amy says she’s starting to feel bad that they’re being mean to these me, the others agree. Until they find Stuart on the app.
When Sheldon and Leonard arrive at the lab with the tank of liquid helium, Sheldon has dressed the tank in a disguise as his “Uncle Harvey” to help them as they wheeled it through the university corridors. When Sheldon sees a torn label on the tank which says “Property of U.”, he worries they are in possession of stolen government property. Leonard argues they have two options: do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or lose it because they’re afraid to break a few rules. Moments later, they wheel the tank out.
At Howard and Bernadette’s, Penny explains the rules of a drinking game for evaluating the male suitors. When Amy’s phone pings with a text from a man, it’s projected on the screen. The group are surprised to read that a guy called Dave wrote that he had a great time on their date last night. After the guys texts to say he’d like to take her out again, Amy admits she went on a date with someone.
When Sheldon and Leonard meet the guy in the parking lot again, they ask for their money and say he can have his helium back. The guy tells them he’ll take the helium back, but they’re not getting their money. After he says he wants to charge them a small helium restocking fee, Sheldon says he hopes it’s not more than the $1000 he has on him. Fortuitously, that’s exactly how much the fee is.
After Penny asks Amy why she didn’t tell them she was dating, Amy says it’s new and weird and she’s just figuring it out. She knew they would get way too excited if she admitted she’d been on dates with a few people. Amy admits it’s mostly just been meeting people for coffee, but she recognised it would be good to get out there.
Back in the lab, Sheldon is disappointed the Swedes might beat them, but relieved they won’t be going to prison. Barry Kripke comes to tell them he was being petty and they can have his helium, but they have to add his name to their paper. After Sheldon and Leonard ask for a minute to consider, they admit they don’t like being extorted by Barry of all people, but what other choice do they have? Later, they return to the parking lot and hand over more money to the guy.
Back in their apartment, Leonard is looking up the definition of a “Mexican Standoff” as he, Sheldon and their helium dealer get ready to watch “Ernest Goes to Jail”."
907,"In the apartment, Leonard tells Penny and Raj about a study that says people who were popular at thirteen don’t do well later in life.

Sheldon asks Penny for advice on appearing in front of the camera.
When Bernadette goes into the living room to talk to Howard, he’s busy playing video games. Bernadette asks him to pause the game so they can talk about redecorating the house. Howard doesn't like to talk about changing things he grew up with, but Bernadette says she wants it to feel like her house too. Bernadette insists she’s redecorating either way and will be removing everything that depresses her, so she suggests he not be one of those things. When Howard asks if he can say something, Bernadette wonders whether he’s going to try guilt her about how his father left and his mother died.
In the apartment, Sheldon phones Amy to leave a message to see whether she wanted to come and see him interviewed for the Spock documentary. After there’s a knock at the door, Sheldon opens and greets Wil Wheaton, who introduces him to Adam Nimoy.
When Bernadette goes to see what Howard’s doing in the kitchen, he tells her he’s making a bologna sandwich like his mother used to make before his dad left and she died. Bernadette says she was thinking they should start by redecorating just one room and suggests the kitchen. Howard says it’s the room he most associates with his mom. After Bernadette proposes the bathroom instead, Howard says he wants to change his answer. Bernadette suggests the dining room. As Howard tries to guilt trip her again, Bernadette says she’ll go pick out paint samples.
As Adam Nimoy sets up his camera in the apartment, he tells Sheldon they’re just going to have a conversation, so try to pretend the camera is not there.

Sheldon goes to his wall-safe to retrieve the napkin
When Raj goes to Howard’s house, Bernadette and her father are measuring the dining room. Bernadette says she and her father were talking about taking down the wall separating the dining room from the living room. After Raj argues it’s a pretty great wall, Bernadette can’t believe Howard brought Raj over to take his side. After Howard says they can’t take the wall down as it’s load bearing, Raj points out it would be easy to find out down in the crawl space.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon shows his Leonard Nimoy napkin to the camera, explaining it contains Leonard Nimoy’s DNA.

After Penny notices a ring box, she is shocked when Sheldon explains it’s an engagement ring he was going to give to Amy. When Penny asks whether Amy knew about the ring, Sheldon says she broke up with him before he got the chance to broach the subject. Penny says that must have been devastating for him, but Sheldon insists it was fine. As Penny tries to comfort him, Sheldon gets emotional and wonders why nobody will listen to him when he says it’s okay. Sheldon tries to change the subject back to Spock.
As Sheldon is being interviewed, he says is mother used to encourage him to ask “What Would Jesus Do?” when he faced a dilemma. Sheldon preferred to consider “What Would Spock Do?”. Sheldon says the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which he’s spent a lifetime mastering. After Penny scoffs, she tells Sheldon he’s missing the point of Spock, who was still half-human. Penny points out that Sheldon, despite pretending he doesn’t, has feelings just like anyone else. Sheldon says he’s not emotional, even though he was rejected by a girl he had an engagement ring for. When Penny points out he’s yelling, Sheldon storms off and questions why no one believes him when he says he’s put the Amy nonsense behind him.
As Howard and Mike crawl beneath the house, Mike says they must be under the dining room now. Mike tells Howard he knows he won’t want to hear it, but it wouldn’t take much work to turn the den into a nursery. When Howard wonders why he wouldn’t want to hear it, Mike says Bernadette told him he doesn’t want kids. Howard says that’s not true at all, he really does want kids and wishes she would get pregnant. As Howard tells Mike that Bernadette’s the one who doesn’t want kids, Bernadette jumps up and down on the floor above, shouting about an earthquake.
In the apartment, Penny tells Leonard she can’t believe Sheldon was going to propose to Amy. When Sheldon comes out of his bedroom, he wonders whether they’re going to put his outburst in the Spock documentary. Sheldon decides there’s no point dwelling on it. Sheldon thinks being upset over Amy all the time isn’t going to accomplish anything, so he’s going to take action. Sheldon tells Leonard and Penny he’s going to find Amy and ask her to marry him. If she says yes, they can put this all behind them.
In the kitchen, Bernadette tells Howard and Mike, who are covered in dust, she should explain why she fibbed. Bernadette admits she didn’t want to disappoint her father by saying she was the one who didn’t want kids. Mike tells her she doesn’t need to worry about him, but want her to miss out. Mike says raising kids was the best experience of his life, Bernadette reminds him that her mother did all the work. After Mike excuses himself, Raj points out Bernadette had a father who didn’t help out and Howard doesn’t help out. Howard accepts he should do more and tells Bernadette that things would be different if they had a kid. When his dad left, he promised himself that if he ever had a chance to be a father he would always be there. Bernadette promises to think about it.

After Sheldon thanks Howard and Raj for coming by, he tells them as they found Amy Farrah Fowler, it was only logical that he employ their services again now he’s seeking a new mate.

After Amy mentions the restaurant where Dave is taking her, Bernadette suggests to Penny that they swing by tonight to get a look at the guy.
Back in the apartment, Howard tells Sheldon he thinks the best approach is to get him on all the dating sites. Sheldon isn’t sure about dating sites as they’re populated by bots pretending to be humans. Instead, he wants prospective women to weed themselves out in a battle of wits. Howard doubts woman would fight for Sheldon, but Raj thinks if Sheldon is presented as a prize it’s only natural that people would compete for him.

Meanwhile, Sheldon, Howard and Raj are happy that the “Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge” is now live.

Back in the restaurant, Dave asks a bored Amy if she can answer another question about Sheldon.

In the restaurant, Dave tells Amy about the time he drove 500 miles to hear Sheldon give a lecture. Amy tells Dave she’s kind of tired and asks if they can call it a night. As they walk out of the restaurant, Bernadette panics that they’re heading right towards them. Even with Leonard’s busy peeing elsewhere, Bernadette tries to make a quick exit and reverses her car right into the car behind.
As Penny and Bernadette get out to inspect the damage, Dave yells that they just hit his car. Bernadette tries to act nonchalant when Amy wonders what her friends are doing there.

Sheldon answers the door to an attractive woman who apologizes for being late as she was in a boring lecture.

Mercifully, Howard manages to get tickets before Sheldon makes a bargain with the Lord.
In the present day, Leonard and Penny tell Sheldon they are really happy that he and Amy are back together. Still, Leonard is more excited for the new Star Wars movie coming out in three days and Sheldon isn’t far behind. When Penny points out that Thursday is also Amy’s birthday, Sheldon doesn’t think that matters as he bought the ticket back when he and Amy were broken up. Penny warns him not to ditch Amy on her birthday so soon after they got back together, but Sheldon is worried that somebody will ruin the movie if he doesn’t see it right away.
In Sheldon’s bedroom, he wakes up to see Arthur Jeffries appear in his Jedi robes. Sheldon isn’t sure why Arthur’s there. In the past, Arthur has appeared to him when he was struggling with a dilemma.

After they come to their senses, they ask Sheldon if he would like to come to the comic book store with them. Sheldon says he can’t as he needs to make preparations for Amy’s birthday. Speaking of Amy’s birthday, Sheldon gives them his ticket to Star Wars and trusts them to give it to someone worthy.
When Sheldon goes across the hall to Penny’s apartment, he asks for their assistance helping select the perfect gift for Amy’s birthday. He’s come up with three ideas: playing the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic, an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival, and, finally, that having coitus with her. Penny is stunned by Sheldon’s proposal and squeezes her wine glass so hard it shatters.
At the comic book store, Leonard asks Howard and Raj what they think about giving Sheldon’s ticket to Stuart.

As the girls leave Penny’s apartment, Amy thanks them for taking her out. When they discuss where to go, Penny suggests they take Amy for a bikini wax. Amy is puzzled why she would get a bikini wax for her birthday. When Bernadette proposes watching a dirty movie and then answering any questions she might have about it, Amy wonders what’s going on. Penny says they want her to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow. Amy is still puzzled, so Bernadette reveals that Sheldon said he’s ready to be physical with  her. Amy is shocked and, temporarily, lost for words. Amy quickly decides a bikini wax is exactly what she wants to do.
When Arthur appears again at night, Sheldon figures he’s there to give advice on being physical with Amy. Arthur tries to avoid the awkward conversation by impaling himself with his own lightsaber, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to have much effect on his hologram. Sheldon tells Arthur he understands the mechanics, but he is worried he might be overwhelmed on such an important night for him and AMy. Arthur assures him if he’s with the right person, it will be okay.
In the apartment, the guys are excited to finally be heading out to see the Star Wars movie.

When he asks if that’s all right, Amy leans over and kisses him.
Back at the movie theater, Leonard asks Wil what he’s doing there if he doesn’t like Star Wars. Wil claims he’s just having fun because everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.

Leonard agrees as, good or bad, they will still be coming back to watch it again tomorrow.
In the apartment, Bernadette wonders whether Sheldon will really go through with it. Penny says Sheldon insisted he’s ready, so she’s going to stay positive.

After Sheldon wonders why she’s shaking, Amy admits she’s nervous. She says she’s been waiting for this for so long and has built it up in her head, she doesn't know what to expect. After Sheldon says he doesn’t know either but they can find out together, they lean in and kiss each other.

912,"Sheldon is on a video chat with Amy, who has made it safely to her hotel in Detroit. After Amy tells him she should go unpack, Sheldon tells her to enjoy the neurobiology conference. When the guys arrive back at the apartment, Sheldon tells them the good news: Amy’s at a conference all weekend so he’s available to be entertained. Howard and Bernadette are busy getting their house ready for the remodel, while Leonard was hoping for a break from Sheldon. Raj has time booked at the telescope lab and he tells Sheldon he is welcome to join him.
When Penny returns home, she tells Leonard he day at work was not great as she still can’t get in to see Dr. Gallo, who refuses to see sales reps. After Penny tells Howard the doctor is a psychiatrist, Howard suggests making an appointment with her as a patient. Since Dr. Gallo already knows Penny is a pharmaceutical rep, so Raj suggests Leonard make the appointment instead. Leonard is reluctant to waste a psychiatrist’s time and worried about what would happen if he gets caught. Leonard eventually relents and tells Penny he will do it because he loves her.
In Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom, she wishes Stuart wasn’t around so she and Howard wouldn’t need to be so quiet during their amorous activities. When Stuart knocks on the door and asks to come in, he tells them he’s going to make things easier for them during the remodel by moving out. Stuart has already found an apartment and will be leaving in a couple of days.
In the telescope lab, Sheldon is pacing around aimlessly as Raj checks the telescope’s camera. When Raj gets angry about Sheldon’s endless interruptions, Sheldon insists he can be helpful if he’s given something to do. Raj tells Sheldon there’s six months of data on a computer and asks him to look through it for any patterns or anomalies. Raj is happy to have distracted Sheldon for a few hours, until he immediately finds an optical transient.
As Leonard goes into Dr. Gallo’s office, he thanks her for seeing him on such short notice. When Dr. Gallo asks whether Leonard is any relation to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Leonard admits he is her daughter. Dr. Gallo says she has read all of Beverly’s books, but does not agree with her views on child-rearing at all. Leonard instantly settles down and sits on the couch to talk to her. Dr. Gallo recognises Leonard is holding onto a lot of anger about his mother, but Leonard claims he’s worked through a lot of that stuff and is better now. Still, he goes on to talk about some of his grievances with his mother.
As Howard and Bernadette carry boxes out to Stuart’s car, Howard says with the house being empty they will finally be able to enjoy themselves in every room of the house. After Stuart packs away another box and gets in his car, Bernadette tells him to let them know when he’s all settled in. Stuart says he really can’t thank them enough for taking him in. After Bernadette watches Stuart drive away, she turns around to see Howard in his underwear ready to “celebrate” in the garage.
Back in the lab, Raj tells Sheldon that when they receive the next image, they will be able to identify exactly what it is that Sheldon found. Sheldon is hoping for a new planet, ideally one with a livable environment he can rule with an iron fist. When the new image arrives, it turns out to be a medium-sized asteroid. Sheldon is somewhat disappointed, but Raj insists it’s still an interesting discovery. Raj goes on to mention that they will get to name the asteroid.
When Leonard returns home, Penny asks how it went. Leonard starts to say how Dr. Gallo is terrific, but Penny interrupts him to ask whether he helped her out. Leonard says that after he talked with Dr. Gallo about how his mother ruined his life, he told her about Penny and she said she would be happy to meet her.
As Howard and Bernadette clean up Stuart’s old room, they talk about what to do with the room. Howard was hoping for a home theater or gaming room, like a man cave, but Bernadette was thinking of a home office. After Howard mentions he hasn’t heard from Stuart since he left, the empty nesters are disturbed to realize they are missing him.
When Sheldon and Raj arrive at the apartment, Raj says he was thinking they could name the asteroid by combining their names. Sheldon thinks that’s a great idea and they should call it “Kooper”; “Koo” from Koothrappali and “per” from Cooper. When Leonard comes out, Sheldon tells him their great news. Leonard wants to talk about his great news, that Dr. Gallo made him realize he is a worthwhile person and his feelings matter. After Sheldon tells Leonard that he discovered an asteroid and gets to name it, Raj is annoyed that he’s being written out of the story. When Leonard suggests they name it after their girlfriends to show them how much they care,  Sheldon suggests taking the “Am” from Amy and the “y” from Emily.
In Dr. Gallo’s office, Penny tells her about the benefits of her company’s new drug, Placinex. After Penny wraps up by asking if Dr. Gallo has any questions, she has one: When Penny made her husband pretend to be a patient to get access to her, what was she thinking there? Penny tries to change the subject back to the drug, but Dr. Gallo would rather talk about why Penny married Leonard. Dr. Gallo says Leonard is someone who was raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. She wonders whether Leonard is perpetuating that relationship by selecting a partner like Penny?
In the apartment, Sheldon starts another video chat with Amy to tell her the good news: she’s an asteroid. Sheldon explains that while working with Raj they discovered an asteroid and Sheldon named it after her. Amy thinks that’s very romantic, but she wonders whether Raj was comfortable with him choosing the name. Sheldon admits Raj took some convincing, but they settled on Sheldon naming the asteroid so long as he and Amy call all their children Rajesh.
In Dr. Gallo’s office, Penny is on the couch as she argues that if anything, Leonard is turning her into his mother. When Penny says she’s not only mother to Leonard but the man-child they have living with them, Dr. Gallo admits Leonard talked about him and she wasn’t sure whether Sheldon was real. Dr. Gallo concedes that Penny has a lot on her plate. Penny admits that Leonard was right, talking to her is really helping.
As Seldon and Amy say they miss each other over video chat, Howard and Bernadette admit they miss Stuart in his empty room, Penny tells Dr. Gallo she misses when life was simpler, and Leonard has fun as he plays jump role with some girls in the neighborhood.
While Howard and Bernadette sleep in their bed, Stuart stands over them and whispers that he really misses this."
913,"When Penny, Bernadette and Emily talk about superheroes as they set the table for dinner in the apartment, Leonard, Howard and Raj listen in shock from the kitchen. Their surprise is short-lived when the girls’ conversation turns to the hunky stars of superhero movies. After Sheldon comes out of the bedroom, he is happy to report that he is feeling much better now. After Sheldon says that his fever is gone and his sinuses are now pressure free, he doesn’t understand why his friends don’t seem very happy to hear about his improvement.
Leonard refreshes Sheldon’s memory: He was rude to Penny when asking her to rub Vicks on his chest. He was dismissive when Bernadette brought him a care package with medication from work and even managed to sneeze on Howard. He belittled Emily’s skill as a dermatologist when Raj suggested she take a look at him. Finally, he was unappreciative when Leonard brought him soup in bed.
In his bedroom, Sheldon starts a video call with Amy to tell her he’s feeling better physically, but is now upset that his friends are mad at him for no reason. Sheldon thought that when you’re sick you get a free pass to say whatever you want and disregard people’s feelings. Amy tells him that when he’s sick he can be unbearable, which is why his friends have been known to work late, sneak out to a movie or stay at a neurobiological conference three days after it’s ended.
When Leonard, Howard and Raj go to the comic book store, Stuart asks whether Sheldon is still sick. Leonard explains that he’s better, but they needed a break from him. After Raj says he wishes they could do more stuff without Sheldon, Howard suggests they take a trip or something. After Leonard mentions that he and Penny have talked about a trip to Vegas, Raj floats the idea of renting a party bus.
In the apartment, Leonard tells Penny about the guys’ plans to take a roadtrip to Vegas. When Sheldon overhears them planning the trip, he asks where they’re going and disappointed to learn it’s Las Vegas. Leonard says that’s fine as Sheldon isn’t invited. Sheldon is hurt not to be invited, especially when he learns that Howard and Raj are also going.
In his bedroom, Sheldon calls Amy to tell her that their friends are jerks and he’s mad at all of them. Sheldon explains they have planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn’t invite him. Amy tells Sheldon that his friends tried to take care of him and he was nothing but mean to them. Sheldon can’t believe she’s not on his side. Amy says she understands he’s mad for being left out, but he should apologise to them. When Sheldon says he’s willing to do that to go on the trip, Amy says he should apologize because he feels bad. Amy explains that is called empathy and it’s something he could work on. Sheldon practices being empathetic by mentioning how Leonard made him soup and he was mean to him. On the third go, Sheldon actually feels something. Sheldon feels terrible when he realizes how bad Leonard must have felt.
Sheldon goes out into the living room to apologize to Leonard. Sheldon says he’s truly sorry for being mean to Leonard as he tried to take care of him. Sheldon insists he is being sincere not just saying it to come on the trip. Leonard tells Sheldon he’s still not coming on the trip. Although he accepts Sheldon’s apology, Leonard is not the only one who Sheldon upset. Sheldon decides it’s time to apologize to everyone on the “Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour”.
In Howard and Bernadette’s living room, Sheldon apologizes to them for treating them terribly as they attempted to comfort him during his illness. Howard says he is impressed, but Sheldon isn’t done. He wants to underscore his sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee’s “I’m Sorry” on the pan flute, but Bernadette and Howard make clear his apology is enough. Nonetheless, Sheldon offers them commemorative t-shirts to memorialize the occasion.
In the apartment bathroom, Sheldon interrupts Penny’s shower to say sorry for his rude and insensitive behavior while she was trying to give him maternal care and affection. Penny accepts his apology and tells him to get out. At the comic book store, Sheldon apologizes to Stuart for being insensitive when he brought him his comic books. Sheldon makes clear he means it and it’s not just about him wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas. Unfortunately, Stuart hasn’t heard about the trip and can only deduce that he was not invited.
In Raj’s apartment, Sheldon tells Raj his illness was no excuse for his behavior. Turning to Emily, Sheldon apologizes for saying dermatologists aren’t real doctors. After he says he’s sure she’s tired of hearing that, Emily can’t believe he thinks she hears that a lot. When Raj tells Sheldon they accept his apology, Emily makes clear to Raj that she does not. Raj argues that Sheldon doesn’t mean it when he’s insulting, prompting Emily to question why Raj is defending him. When Emily tells Sheldon she does not accept his apology, Raj wonders what she’s doing. Emily tells him she is just standing up for herself. When Raj tells her he’s uncomfortable that she’s prolonging this ridiculous fight, Emily storms out of the apartment, telling Sheldon he can go on the trip since she will not be.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon tells Leonard, Penny and Howard about the fight between Raj and Emily. After Sheldon explains he went over to Emily’s to try patch things up, they realize that Emily won't be going on the trip. When Raj arrives, he is upset that Sheldon went to Emily’s to apologize and somehow left her in tears. Raj says he calmed Emily down, but is insistent that she’s not going to Vegas if Sheldon is going. Sheldon says that’s fine as he has decided he won’t be joining them. He realized the most genuine way he can demonstrate the remorse he feels is by letting them have this weekend to themselves.
As the group board the party bus, Leonard proposes a toast to a well deserved weekend- His speech is cut short as Sheldon jumps out of the bathroom. Penny wonders why he couldn’t give them just one weekend. Stuart comes out of the bathroom to say he told Sheldon  this was a bad idea. After Sheldon asks for one more chance to apologize to Emily, he tells her that while he often says the wrong things, in his heart he means well. Sheldon says he thinks she is a smart and wonderful woman. Sheldon apologizes for all the times he has offended her and all the times he will in the future. After Sheldon says he will be leaving now, Emily says he can come with them. Sheldon says they’ll have a better time without him, so he decides to leave with a reluctant Stuart.
Sheldon and Stuart stand on the sidewalk and watch the party bus pull away. After Emily says that she feels bad for Sheldon even though he’s a jerk, the bus comes to a halt and Leonard calls for the “pain in the ass”. Sheldon runs towards the bus and Stuart decides he’s a pain in the ass, too.
Back on the bus, Sheldon asks Emily if she’s relieved that she and Raj patched things up. As a shirtless Raj dances around the stripper pole, Emily says not at that moment."

After she leaves, Howard reminds Raj he has a girlfriend who might not be happy with him helping a beautiful woman with her screenplay.
After Leonard and Penny join Sheldon, Amy and Meemaw in the apartment, Amy wonders why Meemaw calls Sheldon “moon pie”. Meemaw explains it’s because he’s so “nummy-nummy she could just eat him up.” Meemaw is surprised that Leonard and Penny know about Sheldon’s nickname but Amy doesn’t. Meemaw mentions Penny’s new job, saying it’s great how modern women can have a husband and a full-time career. When Amy points out she has a full-time career too, Meemaw argues that does not bode well. Meemaw claims Sheldon needs more tending to than Leonard, whose work is really more of a hobby. 
Amy tells Meemaw she understands she is protective of her grandson, but she points out he is an adult and she may know better what he needs. Meemaw appreciates Amy’s honesty and gives her some more candor in return, declaring she doesn’t like Amy very much. Amy says she doesn’t like Meemaw much either. Amy tells Sheldon she thinks she should leave. Amy mentions how Meemaw gave her a hard time after he left the room.

Amy asks Sheldon when he got an engagement ring. He explains his mother gave it to him and he had been thinking about giving it to her, but then they broke up. After Meemaw expresses her happiness that they split up, Amy asks Sheldon to tell his grandmother to stay out of this. Sheldon doesn’t think he could do that. As Amy and Meemaw bicker, Sheldon asks whether this crankiness is because their cycles have synced. Meemaw tells Sheldon to leave the room and let the grown-ups talk.
When Raj joins Howard and Bernadette in their kitchen, she doesn’t think it’s so bad that Raj is meeting up with a woman to help her with her screenplay. Howard claims that Raj was really flirting earlier, but Bernadette is sure it was harmless. Bernadette says the real question is where is he with Emily. Raj thinks they’re good, but things like this make him wonder if she’s really the woman for him. After Raj asks them if they had doubts early in their relationship, Howard says no but Bernadette absolutely did.
In Leonard and Penny’s apartment, Penny admits there wasn’t this much excitement the last time she saw her grandmother. When Sheldon comes over, he explains they asked him to leave so they could speak privately. Sheldon admits it was quite tense over there, so he wonders which one of them will go over and collect his toy trains.

Howard and Bernadette point out Raj has already said he has “made up his mind” a few times tonight. When Raj calls Claire, he tells her that he has a girlfriend and didn’t want to mislead her after she asked him out. Claire makes clear that she did not ask him out. She only wanted help with her screenplay. After Raj apologizes for wasting her time and wishes her luck with the screenplay, Claire points out they’re both adults and can get together without it meaning anything. After Claire insists they would just be meeting for coffee, Raj accepts her invitation. Raj tells Howard and Bernadette that he will tell Emily as they have no secrets, but Howard wonders when he will tell Emily.
Back in the apartment, Amy tells Meemaw she has no idea how much she puts up with from Sheldon. Meemaw argues she has lots of experience living with a stubborn, egotistical man as that was her husband. Amy wonders why she’s giving her such a hard time then.

Raj says he will be spending Valentine’s Day with Emily, but he doesn’t sound very happy about it. Ever since he met Claire, he’s been wondering whether he and Emily are right for eachother. Howard and Leonard tell him he should just break up with her if he is no longer sure, but Raj says it’s easy for them to say that as they have never broken up with anyone.
When Raj joins Penny and Leonard in their apartment, he asks her for advice on how to break up with Emily. Penny advises him to do it at her place, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears. Later, Emily is stunned that Raj would break up with her so close to Valentine’s Day. Not long later, Raj calls Claire to see if she is free for Valentine’s Day as he has just broken up with his girlfriend. Claire, who just got back together with her boyfriend, thinks Raj is an ass for breaking up with someone right before Valentine’s Day. Later still, Raj pleads with Emily to take him back, but she slams the door in his face. Finally, Raj cries to Penny that he’s going to be alone on Valentine’s Day.
As Sheldon and Amy prepare the apartment for their live stream of Fun with Flags, Sheldon is nervous that people might not be around to watch.

It’s now called “Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon Cooper’s Fun with Flags”.
When Howard goes out to check the temperature on his hot tub, he is disturbed to find a rat flopping around in there.

Unfortunately, the maitre’d asks if anyone dropped the money and a tall guy claims it as his. Leonard returns to Penny and insists he took care of it.
Back in the apartment, Amy and Sheldon’s live stream begins. Amy invites the audience to contact them with their flag questions and comments during the show. When they receive their first call, it turns out to be Raj who wants to know why he is so self-destructive. Sheldon tries to cut Raj off as it’s not a flag-related question, but Amy stops him.
After Bernadette manages to catch the rat in a strainer, she says it isn’t moving but she thinks it’s still alive. Bernadette tells Howard it’s actually a rabbit and they need to save it. When she asks Howard to look up how to help an injured rabbit, Howard says they need to make it comfortable and warm, which shouldn’t be a problem as it was just in the hot tub.
Back at the restaurant, Penny is fed up of waiting and decides to talk to the maitre’d herself. When Penny tries to flirt with him, he tells her there’s nothing he can do and refers to her as “ma’am”. Penny is horrified and insists they’re a similar age, prompting the twenty-one-year-old maitre’d to scoff. When Penny returns to Leonard, she tells him they’re leaving because she is young.
A glum Sheldon sits quietly as Amy tells Raj it’s perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone. Sheldon tells him it’s not normal to be blubbering about emotions during a flag show, however. Amy is surprised when they get another call. It’s Barry Kripke, who wants to talk about how lonely he is. When Barry turns the call into a personals ad, Sheldon insists all comments should be flag-related.
As Howard feeds the rabbit with a pipette, Bernadette thinks it’s a good sign that the rabbit is eating. Bernadette and Howard agree the rabbit is pretty cute.

Penny concedes she was just hungry and cranky as she’s never been called ma’am before. Penny mentions she was twenty-two when she met him and she wonders where the time has gone. Leonard suggests they do something fun tonight, so when they are actually old they will look back on this night and remember the good time they had.
Sheldon is at the end of his tether as Amy tries to cheer up with Raj and Kripke. Amy knows they feel bad about being alone, but she says they should take some time for themselves. Raj points out that after Amy broke up with Sheldon, she started dating right away. Raj says before Emily he was alone for so long, he’s not sure if he can do that again.

Back on Howard and Bernadette’s deck, he says that rabies is highly unlikely in rabbits but he is still worried. Bernadette offers to take the rabbit to the vet to have him tested, but Howard learns that the only way to test a rabbit for rabies is to cut off its head and check its brain. Howard admits that the rabbit doesn’t have any symptoms, but he decides to go to the emergency room just to be safe. After Howard goes back inside, Bernadette tells the rabbit she’ll find another day to tell him she’s pregnant.
Amy is as glum as Sheldon as the discussion of Raj’s personal life continues to dominate their live show. Sheldon has had enough and wipes his name off the title. After Raj apologizes for bothering Sheldon,Amy chides him for not being very sympathetic to his friend. Sheldon tries to be helpful and tells Raj he knows breakups can be painful, but he points out pain has an evolutionary purpose by providing information from the environment that our behavior isn’t good for us. Sheldon tells Raj he’s sorry that he’s suffering, he also suffered when he and Amy broke up. Surprisingly, Sheldon says he is thankful that he went through it as their relationship is now stronger than ever. Amy tells Sheldon she feels the same way, but their heartfelt discussion is interrupted as Leonard and Penny, dressed in skimpy Valentine’s Day-themed outfits, barge in and make a big display with confetti and air horns.
As Sheldon and Amy celebrate the success of their live show, Penny and Leonard are busy cleaning up the confetti from the apartment floor."
916,"When Howard gets up and goes into the kitchen, Bernadette is eating breakfast at the table. Howard notices a Post-it note attached to a mug, which reads “We.” The back of the note directs Howard to the milk, where the second note says “are”. After he is sent to the spoons for more information, Howard is stunned to see the word “pregnant” on the final note. After Howard asks if she’s sure, Bernadette shows him the positive pregnancy test. Howard hugs Bernadette and says the news is incredible, but he quickly starts to freak out about the difficulties of raising a child. Bernadette tells him to calm down, but Howard thinks he’s a mess and so their baby will be half a mess.
As Sheldon, Leonard and Raj set up a board game in the apartment, Howard arrives and says he has something to tell them. After Howard says he’s going to be a father, Leonard and Raj congratulate him, but Sheldon is unhappy at how the change will affect him.
When Penny and Amy join Bernadette on her deck, she says there’s something she wants to share with them. Bernadette’s big reveal is ruined as Penny receives a text from Leonard with the news that Bernadette is pregnant. Amy and Penny are happy for her, but they wonder why Bernadette isn’t more enthusiastic. Bernadette explains she was excited to break the news to Howard, who has talked about having kids for years, but he is freaking out and now this feels like a bad idea. They tell Bernadette not to read too much into Howard reactively negatively, as it was probably just the initial shock.
Back in the apartment, Howard tells the guys he shouldn’t be raising a kid. Leonard thinks he may be overreacting, but Howard asks if they have any idea how much it costs to raise a child in Los Angeles. Howard realizes he has to start earning more money right now. After Raj tells Howard this is great news and he knows it, Howard concedes he’s just overwhelmed right now. Leonard tells the guys they should all go out and celebrate. Elsewhere, Penny tells Bernadette they should go out and celebrate, Bernadette points out she can’t do a lot of things now she’s pregnant. Her doctor says no alcohol, no sushi, and no hot tub.
At a tiki bar, Raj proposes a toast to Howard. Looking at his cocktail, Howard wonders how much money the inventor of the little umbrellas made. Howard says if he is to have any chance of raising this kid, he needs to come up with a big idea to make some money. Leonard tells him there’s no reason he can’t, but Howard thinks that’s easy for him to say as he and Sheldon have the superfluid helium model. Leonard insists it’s just research and they’ll never make any money from it. As Sheldon’s mood lightens up, Leonard warns him to take it easy with the cocktails.
Howard runs an idea for an invention by the guys: slightly bigger umbrellas for drinks. When an inebriated Sheldon wonders why they’ve never been to this bar before, Leonard says it’s the same reason they don’t do a lot of fun stuff, him. Having downed another cocktail, Sheldon rushes off in search of the bathroom, only to run into the kitchen. Howard asks whether Leonard whether he and Sheldon have created quantum vortices in their supercooled helium experiments. Hearing they have, Howard proposes using the vortices in a gyroscope which could maintain an infinite persistence.
On Bernadette’s deck, Amy and Penny tell Bernadette about all the fun things she’ll get to do as a parent. When Amy asks when they decided to get pregnant, Bernadette admits they didn’t really decide. Bernadette explains they were out one night and got a little spontaneous. After Bernadette mentions that it was the night Sheldon was rambling on about railroads and train schedules, Penny realizes Howard and Bernadette did it at their place. Amy is shocked when Bernadette reveals it was on Sheldon’s bed.
Back at the bar, the guys are searching the Internet and are happy to find that noone has used quantum vortices like this. After Leonard asks Sheldon to focus on what they’re talking about, he manages to brilliantly validate their theory even while inebriated. Howard argues they could get a patent and license this to companies to make guidance systems. The guys are proud of Howard for stepping up after knowing he was going to be a father for less than a day. As someone who also grew up without a father, Sheldon tells Howard he is confident that he is going to the best dad he can be.
As the girls sit with their feet dipped in the hottub, Penny gets a text from Leonard, who says Sheldon is drunk and they’re going to do karaoke. After Penny mentions that Leonard invited them to join the guys, Bernadette says that sounds fun.
Back at the bar, Leonard and Raj are doing a duet of “Bust a Move”. After the girls arrive, Howard tells Bernadette he’s glad she’s there and asks to talk privately. Howard apologizes for freaking out earlier. After he says he wants her to know he’s done being scared, Bernadette says it’s okay to be nervous and that she is too. Howard tells her he is really excited and he means it.
With Bernadette sitting in a chair between them, Penny and Amy serenade her with Justin Bieber’s song “Baby”. Howard then sings “Baby I Need Your Loving” to her.

With one hand on his chest and another on Bernadette’s shoulder, Sheldon sings the patriotic song “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee”.
Howard tells the audience he would like to dedicate his last song of the evening to his wife and the mother of his child. Howard tells Bernadette he loves her before he sings “(You’re) Having My Baby”. Howard’s touching performance is interrupted by Sheldon, who just learned that Howard and Bernadette had coitus in his bedroom. Howard thanks the audience, drops the mic and rushes out of the bar.
The next morning, as Leonard and Penny make tea, they both say they are happy for Howard and Bernadette. When Leonard asks Penny if she ever thinks about having a baby, she says she isn’t in a rush, but someday in the future sure. Leonard thinks they would make amazing parents. A hungover Sheldon, who has magic marker all over his face, asks them to keep it down as he tries to sleep on the couch. Penny concedes they might lack a certain maturity to be parents."
917,"As Sheldon and Amy walk down the stairs with Leonard and Penny, Amy raises a touchy subject with Sheldon. After Amy says she was hoping they could celebrate his upcoming birthday, Sheldon says he supposes that’s a discussion they could have. Amy thinks that’s great, until she turns around and sees Sheldon has disappeared.
As the group return to the apartment to look for Sheldon, he jumps out from behind the couch and scares them. Sheldon explains that is just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. When Amy asks why he doesn’t like to celebrate his birthday, Sheldon explains that nobody he liked would ever attend the joint parties he had with his twin sister. Sheldon says his sister’s friends would spend the whole day torturing him. Once, his sister made him believe Batman was coming to his party so he spent the whole day waiting by the door. Amy tells Sheldon that none of those things would happen to him now. After Sheldon questions why it’s so important to Amy that he celebrate his birthday, she explains it’s because he made her last birthday so memorable. After Penny tells Sheldon he has plenty of friends now who would love to come, Sheldon agrees that they can throw him a party.
At the comic book store, Howard asks Raj what he’s getting Sheldon for his birthday. After Leonard notices a Batman figurine in the store, he mentions the story Sheldon told about his sister tricking him into thinking Batman was coming to his party. After Leonard wonders if they could get Batman to actually show up, he talks to Stuart, who tried to get Adam West to do a signing in the store. Stuart agrees to give Leonard his contact information.
As they gather around the kitchen table in the apartment, the girls ask Sheldon about his preferences for the party: mylar balloons, no music, and chocolate cake with strawberry frosting.
When Leonard, Howard and Raj drive to Adam West’s house to pick him up, Raj talks about his favorite Batman actors. Back in the apartment, Penny thanks Stuart for helping with the cake as she rushes around preparing for the party. Meanwhile, as Leonard and the guys drive back with Adam West, he shares his opinions on the other Batman actors. Howard is surprised that Adam West puts himself above Christian Bale, but West insists people knew he was Batman without him having to say the phrase “I’m Batman.” After Howard asks if they can all agree they’re worried about Affleck, West wonders what an affleck is.
As Amy fixes Sheldon’s tie in Leonard and Penny’s living room, he wonders if there’s a reason he had to leave his apartment. Amy says they want him to see it for the first time all decorated. After Amy tells Sheldon he looks good in his suit, she wonders whether she will get to see him in his birthday suit later. A puzzled Sheldon says this is his birthday suit.
As Leonard and Penny chat with Beverly in the apartment, he is surprised Beverly came all this way for Sheldon’s birthday. Beverly says she was happy to after Sheldon came to her 60th. Leonard is irked that she had a birthday party without him, but Penny points out they didn’t invite her to their wedding in Vegas. Meanwhile, Sheldon is sitting anxiously on Penny’s couch when Amy’s phone beeps. After saying Penny said everyone is there, Amy asks if he’s ready. Sheldon says he is.
As they walk across to the apartment, Sheldon stops suddenly and admits he feels a little light-headed. Amy asks if he needs a minute, but he says he thinks he can do this. As Sheldon enters the room, the guests cheer and shout “Happy Birthday”. After Leonard calls for a speech, Sheldon thanks everybody for coming. He is surprised to see Beverly, Wil Wheaton, and Adam West for some reason. Leonard explains that Batman finally came to his party. As Sheldon tells them this is all so thoughtful, his heartbeat quickens as he looks around the room at all the faces. Sheldon excuses himself and runs off to the bathroom.
After Leonard and Amy argue over who knows Sheldon the best and should go talk to him, Penny has enough and takes it upon herself to go see Sheldon. After Sheldon lets her in to the bathroom, Penny asks what’s going on. Sheldon says looking around the room and seeing all the faces and presents was too much. When Sheldon apologizes for ruining the party she worked hard to put together, Penny insists he’s not ruining it. After Sheldon tells her he doesn’t think he can go back out there, Penny says it’s fine. When she sits down with him on the bathtub, Penny tells Sheldon that she hates that his sister and her friends used to torture him. What she hates even more is that she knows she would have tortured him too if she was there. Penny admits there was a time she never would have been friends with someone like Sheldon, but now he is one of her favorite people. Penny tells him that if he needs to spend his birthday in a bathroom, she’s happy to do it with him. After Sheldon worries everyone will think he’s weird, Penny tells him he is weird and everyone knows it, but all came because they care about him so much.
Back in the living room, Leslie Winkle catches up with Leonard. When he tells her so much has changed since they last saw each other, Leslie isn’t sure. After Leonard mentions he and Penny got married, Leslie congratulates him, admitting she thought he would be living with Sheldon forever. Unsure what to say, Leonard tells her not to be a stranger.
Penny comes out of the bathroom to tell the crowd that Sheldon is going to return, but he’s a little embarrassed so they should all be extra nice. When Sheldon appears, he apologizes for his behavior and tells everyone to enjoy themselves. After Amy proposes a toast to Sheldon, she explains she feels like she got the greatest gift the day he was born. Enjoying the fun, Sheldon asks for other people to say wonderful things about him.
The toasts continue coming from Howard, Wil Wheaton, Beverly, Raj, Leslie Winkle, Adam West, Bernadette and Leonard. When it’s Stuart’s chance at last, he gets cut off by Amy who is holding a laptop with a video call with Stephen Hawking. When Professor Hawking starts singing “Happy Birthday”, Leonard asks for a second to light the candles so they can all sing together.
After Stephen Hawking leads a long-distance round of “Happy Birthday”, Sheldon blows out the candles on his cake. Adam West asks which one of them is taking him home."
918,"As Sheldon, Leonard and Howard sit in waiting room, Howard wonders why Sheldon is wearing a bow-tie. He explains he’s never applied for a patent before and wanted to make a good impression. After the patent attorney invites them into his office, he says he has reviewed their paperwork and they have everything they need to file for a patent. He asks them to review and sign a document acknowledging the university will own 75% of the patent. The guys are stunned that they would lose such a huge portion of their profits, but he points out the university has been paying their salaries for over 10 years. The attorney also breaks the news that Howard, as a federal employee on loan from NASA, isn’t entitled to an ownership share. The guys refuse to sign the document and quickly leave the attorney’s office.
In Penny’s apartment, she and Amy ask Bernadette how she’s coping with her pregnancy. Bernadette says she’s been experiencing morning sickness and has a heightened sense of smell. Raj comes to talk to them about a gift that Emily left on his doorstep after they broke up. In a note, Emily explained she bought it before they broke up and couldn’t return it. Bernadette thinks it’s a nice gesture, but Penny wonders whether Emily’s trying to manipulate him into getting back together. When Raj opens the gift, it’s an antique sextant which sailors use to find their position by the stars. Amy thinks it’s a great gift for Raj, which further convinces Penny that Emily is trying to win him back.
Over in the apartment, the guys are still down about their patent news. Leonard suggests going around the university, but Howard says the university would still have a controlling interest in anything they come up with. When Leonard realizes their choices are to do it with the university or not do it all, Howard says either way he gets nothing. After Leonard proposes that he and Sheldon split their profits with Howard, Sheldon is excited to draw up a contract.
Back in Penny’s apartment, Amy looks how much the sextant cost and finds out they go for $500 and up. Penny sees it as further proof that Emily was just trying to get back with Raj, Bernadette thinks she might be telling the truth and was just trying to be nice. When Raj gets a phone call from Emily, Penny tells him to answer it but urges him to be strong. After he answers the call and puts it on speaker phone, Raj looks to the girls for guidance but they have mixed opinions. When Emily asks Raj whether they could grab a cup of coffee, Raj waits for the girls’ decision. As Emily sobs and asks him to come over, the girls signal that she should not do it. Raj feels bad but tells Emily he doesn’t think it’s a good idea. Raj decides to go, saying he wants to be alone now. As he leaves, Penny asks him to say hi to Emily for them.
In the apartment’s kitchen, Howard and Leonard review the contract that Sheldon drew up. When the girls come over, Bernadette says she is a little tired and wonders whether he wants to go. Howard asks for a minute to sign the contract, explaining their patent issue and how they’re forming a partnership to split the profits equally. After Bernadette urges Howard to have a lawyer look at it, Howard argues the guys were nice enough to find a way to share the money with him. Bernadette points out it was his idea, but Amy argues Howard’s idea built Sheldon’s math. As Penny works on a hangnail, Leonard comes to his own defence and says they all worked on the project.
After Howard asks to speak to Bernadette in the hallway, he questions what she is doing. Bernadette wants to make sure he’s thought this through, but Howard doesn’t see what there is to think about. After Bernadette warns him he is about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper, Howard recognises Bernadette is making an excellent point. Howard gets it and tells her he’s pleased she is worrying about him. Bernadette argues she’s not worried about him, she just doesn’t want to spend the whole pregnancy listening to Howard complain about working with Sheldon.
As Raj drives to Emily’s, he gets a phone call from Claire, who admits things didn’t work out with her boyfriend. Claire says if he’s still interested they could meet up. When she asks what he’s doing now, Raj explains he was stopping by his ex-girlfriend’s because she’s having a tough time. Claire guesses exactly what Emily said to try win Raj back, claiming it’s page one of the playbook.
As Sheldon, Leonard and Amy wait in the apartment, Penny is stood by the door trying to listen to what Howard and Bernadette are talking about. After they return, Howard tells the guys he is concerned about the three of them forming a partnership. Howard explains his concern is not about the money, but how Sheldon treats him. When Sheldon points out that the contract stipulates that Howard’s contributions are as valuable as his own, Bernadette wonders if he’s saying Howard’s contributions aren’t as valuable. Howard argues this is what happens every time they work together. Penny wonders what would happen if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful. She proposes adding a clause to the contract that says Sheldon cannot make fun of Howard. 
As Raj drives in his car, he calls Emily to explain he doesn’t think it would be a good idea for him to come over. Emily gets upset and starts crying. Later, Raj calls Claire to tell her about the change of plans. She warns Raj that Emily is playing him. Later still, Raj tells Emily he can’t come by as he worries they would get back together. Emily insists she just needs a friend and asks what he think will happen, so Raj asks if he can call her right back.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon has handed out copies of the revised contract to the Penny, Howard and Amy. After Howard reads the addendum that would prevent Sheldon from insulting him, Leonard wonders whether there should be a no-insult clause about him, too. When Penny notices changes on page six, Amy worries about what Sheldon has done now. Bernadette reads the change that stipulates that 25% of Sheldon’s profits will be put in a scholarship fund for Howard and Bernadette’s baby. Bernadette and Howard are touched by his generosity. Sheldon admits that Howard needing a written guarantee of respect has made him realize how dismissive he was of his contributions.
Raj is still driving around, unsure where to go. When he calls Claire to say he thinks Emily deserves the benefit of the doubt, she warns him how things will end if he goes over to see Emily. Raj claims he will just be a comforting friend, there when she needs someone to talk to. Later, Raj and Emily lay in bed together after a “good talk.”"
919,"At his desk in the apartment, Sheldon is in a video chat with Amy, who tells him she didn’t understand his email. After Sheldon explains the “S, R and M” keys on his keyboard are broken, Amy tells him to get a new laptop as the sound is failing and the video is cutting out. He asks her to repeat that as the sound is cutting out. When she writes it down and holds it up, he can’t read it as the video is failing. Amy urges him to get a new computer, but Sheldon can’t understand what she’s saying. Amy calls him on the phone and shouts “Get a new computer!”
In Howard’s lab, Leonard wonders when they last built something together. When Penny and Bernadette arrive to see how they’re doing, Leonard and Howard say it’s going well but there’s a lot of tedious setup to go through first. After Penny asks if there’s anything they can do, Leonard says this part isn’t so technical so they actually could help. As Leonard and Howard solder boards, they ask Penny and Bernadette to wrap pipe fittings with Teflon tape.
When Sheldon’s laptop cuts out on him one last time, he closes the lid and stands up. After Amy arrives and says she got there as quickly as she could, Sheldon says she’s too late. He starts playing “Taps” and lays a black cloth over his laptop. Amy says she’s sorry for his loss, but she got him something that should make him feel better: a new computer. Sheldon is upset that she robbed him of weeks of agonising thought and tedious research. When Amy mentions the guy at the store said this one is great, Sheldon is doubtful until he learns the laptop meets all his exacting standards. Sheldon realizes Amy talked to Rick on Colorado Boulevard, who really knows his stuff.
Back at the lab, Leonard explains the procedure for wrapping pipes to Penny and Bernadette. After Howard tells Leonard he’s not sure they have enough solder to finish all the circuit boards, Leonard says they will have to make a run to the hardware store. He asks if Penny and Bernadette want to come with them, but the women say they are getting in the groove here.
In the apartment, Sheldon thanks her for the thoughtful gift as he turns on his impressive new laptop for the first time. When Amy mentions that Rick said he could bring his old laptop in for store credit, Sheldon says no thanks. When Amy questions why Sheldon wouldn’t want the credit, Sheldon asks her to change the subject. Amy wants to know why he’s being so weird about this. Sheldon insists he’s not being weird, but it’s hard to explain. After Amy asks him to just tell her, Sheldon says it might be easier to show her. Sheldon explains they’ll need to take her car and he will need her to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
As Howard and Leonard walk to the hardware store, Leonard says Penny texted him to say they’re having fun working on the prototype. When a guy stops them outside the movie theatre to ask if they’re interested in a free showing, Leonard says they can’t bu Howard is intrigued. The guy can’t tell them the name of the movie, but he mentions it stars Will Smith. Howard thinks it might be Suicide Squad and manages to talk Leonard into seeing the movie, saying it’s better than spending the afternoon wrapping tape around pipe fittings.
Back at the lab, Penny thinks it’s crazy how she, a former actress from Nebraska, is now sitting in a lab at Caltech working on a high-tech guidance system. Bernadette thinks it’s crazy how she’s made fourteen of the pipes and Penny’s made three. When Raj knocks on the door, he wonders where the guys are. Penny explains they went to the store to get solder. When Raj asks if they need any help, they girls say they’re good. After he leaves, Bernadette feels bad and wonders whether they should have asked him to stay.
As Amy drives Sheldon to the secret location, she demands to know where they’re going. Sheldon says she’s on a need-to-know basis. Amy points out she’s driving the car so she needs to know.
After Leonard and Howard take their seats in the theater, they wonder how to explain their absence to Penny and Bernadette. Back at the lab, Penny gets a text from Leonard to say they got a flat tire on their way to San Bernardino. At the theater, the audience learn they are indeed about to see Suicide Squad. Howard decides to text Raj to gloat about seeing the movie. Back in the lab, Raj reads Howard’s text and tells Penny and Bernadette that Howard and Leonard are at the movies. Raj wants to let them know they’re busted, but the girls say it would be more fun to let them think they’ve gotten away with it.
At a storage locker, Amy wonders why Sheldon has his own unit. Sheldon opens it up and reveals his “Fortress of Shame”. It’s packed with everything he has ever owned: every book, every t-shirt, every piece of broken electronics, all of it. Amy says she would like to tell him that there is nothing here to be ashamed of, so she’s going to need a minute.
In the lab, Penny wonders how they are going to play this when Leonard and Howard return. Bernadette points out that they don’t know Raj is there with them, so he should hide in the closet when the guys return. After the girls pretend to believe whatever dumb story the guys tell them, she suggests Raj should jump out.
In Sheldon’s storage unit, he shows Amy his extensive collection of old belongings. Amy wonders why Sheldon feels the need to save things. Sheldon says he’d like to think it’s nostalgia, but anytime he considers throwing anything away his ears start to ring and he gets butterflies in his stomach. Sheldon apologizes, saying he’s sorry if she thinks less of him. Amy says she doesn't, but Sheldon admits he thinks less of himself each time he comes in there. He explains it makes him feel like a fraud. He purports to be a man of the mind and a vocal champion of The Singularity, but how can he leave his body behind when he has never even thrown away a toothbrush. Amy says she has saved weird things too, including a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain she ever dissected.
After Penny returns to the lab to say the guys are on the way, Raj climbs into the closet. When Leonard and Howard walk in, they are each carrying a bouquet of flowers. They tell their Penny and Bernadette that they did a stupid thing. The guys admit they went to a movie and lied about it, but they say they feel bad and want to make it up by taking them out to dinner. Bernadette thanks them for being honest and Penny concedes they did have fun working on the prototype. When Raj jumps out of the closet to bust them for lying, the girls insist it’s okay as the guys apologized. After the couples leave for dinner, Bernadette wonders whether they should invite Raj.
As they sit in the storage locker, Sheldon tells Amy she is the only one who knows about this. Amy thanks him for trusting her and tells Sheldon she’s there for him if he ever wants to do something about this. When Sheldon says he wouldn’t know how to begin, Amy proposes baby steps. Sheldon picks up the golf ball his brother threw at his head and says he could try getting rid of it. After they walk out of the locker, Sheldon throws the golf ball’s box into the trash. After Amy asks if he feels okay, Sheldon says he does. Amy tells Sheldon she’s proud of him. As Sheldon pulls down the door to the locker, he rolls the golf ball back inside.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon tells Amy he is glad he told her about the storage locker. They both agree they feel closer to each other now. After Sheldon tells her it’s a couple of hours until his bedtime, Amy wonders what he had in mind. Later, in his bed, Sheldon tells Amy she looks amazing as he looks at her video chat window on his new laptop. Sheldon is amazed by the picture quality, while Amy is grumpy at being made to go home for this."
920,"Sheldon is wearing a virtual reality headset at his desk and seeing a forest scene as Leonard, Penny and Amy return to the apartment. When Sheldon holds out his finger for a butterfly, Leonard puts his face up against Sheldon’s finger and surprises him. After Sheldon takes off the VR set, he explains he was trying to experience the outdoors because of a study that showed the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
When Amy brings Sheldon a cup of tea as he is once again immersed in the wild, she tells him they should rent a cabin if he really wants to experience nature. Penny mentions there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor keeps offering her. Amy thinks they could all go for the weekend and it would be fun. Leonard and Penny are up for it, but Sheldon doesn’t see the appeal of the actual wilderness on account of all the mosquitos, bees, bears, possums, snakes, etc. Amy manages to change Sheldon’s mind by pointing out if his study is real, Leonard might return from the woods smarter than he is.
After Bernadette and Raj return to her house with groceries, he is carrying all the shopping bags for her as she is carrying a baby. After Howard pauses his video game, he asks her where she was. Bernadette explains they went to the OBGYN and then to the grocery store. Howard didn’t know she needed help running errands, but Bernadette says Raj just volunteered. Bernadette says Raj has been making a fuss over her ever since he found out she was pregnant. Howard thinks it’s sweet, until Raj starts talking about lactation experts.
Penny goes back up to the apartment to tell Leonard that Amy is ready downstairs. As Leonard packs a rucksack, Penny is not impressed by his new baseball cap. When Sheldon comes out wearing a beekeeper's hat, Penny doesn’t have any negative comments.
When Howard goes to the kitchen after hearing some strange screams, he wonders what Bernadette is watching on her iPad. Bernadette explains it’s one of many childbirth videos that Raj sent her. Howard asks her if she feels Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff, but Bernadette thinks he just wants to be part of the experience. When Howard finds a box in the kitchen, Bernadette explains it’s an ultrasonic microphone that Raj bought her. Howard wants to try it, but she promised Raj they would wait until he was there to use it so he can be part of the experience.
As Leonard drives Penny, Sheldon and Amy to the cabin, Penny says it’s nice and rustic out there. After Sheldon points out his cell service has dropped to one bar, Amy asks if he’s ever been off the grid before. Sheldon says once, when the battery on his phone ran out and he had to wait for his iPad to turn on.
In Howard and Bernadette’s living room, he is looking out the window as Raj pulls up. Howard tells Bernadette that he’s going to say something to Raj about how involved he is in the pregnancy. Bernadette thinks he should leave Raj alone as he means well. When Howard questions whether he needs to rein it in a little, Bernadette argues he’s just being supportive. Howard asks if he’s not being over-the-top, but Bernadette insists not. As Raj walks in, he is carrying a stuffed teddy bear that’s larger than he is.
After they arrive at their destination, Penny is impressed by how great the cabin is. Leonard thinks it’s wonderful that doctor at work just let her use it, but Penny admits she has to go to an Indigo Girls concert with her. When Sheldon suggests they check each other for ticks, Amy doesn’t see a need as they only walked in from the car. But when Sheldon drops his pants, she is more than happy to examine him.
As the rain pours down outside, Sheldon expresses faux disappointment that they won’t be able to go on their planned hike. Amy wonders what they should do now. Leonard points out there’s board games, but Sheldon already checked and they’re all missing pieces. After Penny proposes lighting a fire, Sheldon and Leonard start discussing the thermodynamic principles of lighting an optimal fire. In the meantime, Penny just flicks a switch and ignites the fire.
In Howard and Bernadette’s living room, Howard tells Raj he is his best friend and he really appreciates his enthusiasm about having a baby. Bernadette says she and Howard do want him to be a part of this pregnancy, but Howard says they have to set some boundaries. Howard points out the three of them aren’t having this baby, just him and Bernadette. Raj agrees to back off and give them some space. He decides to take the massive teddy bear back, but he struggles to carry it away. As Raj gracelessly fights to shift the brobdingnagian bear, Bernadette tells Raj to wait but Raj asks to leave with his dignity.
Back at the cabin, as Penny pours wine for everyone, she asks her friends if they want to play a drinking game. After Penny explains the rules of “Never Have I Ever”, she offers to go first. Penny declares she has never… well, it takes her a while to think of something she’s never done before, so Leonard goes next. When Leonard says never have I ever been arrested, the group are shocked as Sheldon takes a drink. Sheldon explains he jaywalked to escape an aggressive-looking girl scout during cookie season. A police officer witnessed the whole thing and arrested Sheldon. After he confronted the officer for doing nothing about his jaywalking, that is.
As Howard tidies up the mess caused by Raj’s bear, he admits he feels like he made a huge mistake telling Raj to back off. After Bernadette starts crying, Howard decides to go get Raj. Bernadette asks him to get the bear back, too.
After Leonard tells Penny this game is dangerous and he could get her in trouble, he demonstrates by saying never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink. Penny returns the favor by saying never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals. On Amy’s turn, she says never have I ever rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed and urges Sheldon to drink. When Sheldon says never have I ever kept a secret bank account because I think my wife can’t handle money, Penny glares at Leonard as Sheldon wonders whether he won. Penny confronts Leonard, pointing out she earns more money than he does. Penny says they’re married and are supposed to share everything, but Leonard wonders whether that means her massive credit card debt. Penny storms off to the bedroom.
Raj tells Howard he appreciates the apology, but he understands he overstepped his bounds. After Raj asks if there’s anything he can do to help, Howard says they can try out the ultrasonic microphone to listen to the baby’s heartbeat. Raj is pleased they would let him stay for that, but he makes it weird again by asking if he can squirt the ultrasound on her stomach.
As Penny paces around the bedroom in anger, Leonard comes to apologize and say she has every right to be angry. After Penny asks about the bank account, Leonard admits he’s had it a few years and has saved around $6,400. When Penny asks if he knows what she could do with that kind of money, Leonard says he does and that’s why he hid it. After Leonard apologizes for keeping it a secret, Penny says she has been keeping a secret from him. She admits she doesn’t like flirting with doctors for sales and has not liked her job for a while. After Leonard asks why she didn’t tell him, Penny explains it’s because she knows her success is important to him. Leonard insists he would be happy if she want back to being an actress and waiting tables, but Penny admits she doesn’t want to do that. She says she’s going to do the grown-up thing and see this job through.
Back in Howard and Bernadette’s living room, Howard puts the microphone up against her belly. They are all amazed when they hear the baby’s heartbeat. A stunned Raj tells them they made a person. As Howard puts his head on Bernadette’s shoulders, Raj does the same and says he’d like to think he helped. Howard points out he didn’t.
In the cabin, Sheldon and Amy are still playing “Never Have I Ever” but are struggling to find anything either of them have actually done. When Sheldon says never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator, Amy takes a sip."
921,"At the comic book store, Sheldon tells the guys he has a question about Batman and Manbat. When Raj gets a text message from Claire, he explains he is seeing both her and Emily. After Raj leaves to go meet Claire, Leonard can’t hide his surprise that the guy who couldn’t talk to women for years is now going out with two of them.
In the apartment, Leonard is preparing snacks and has bought a party sub for their Game of Thrones viewing party. After Sheldon reminds Leonard that their quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting is tomorrow, an exasperated Leonard says they don’t need a meeting every three months and he’s not going. Sheldon says they don’t have to have a roommate agreement if he doesn’t want, but it will require a vote. He gets out his travel gavel for the motion, but it fails to pass after nobody votes for it. Leonard asks Penny to talk to Sheldon, but she can’t see why he’s fighting Sheldon on this. Leonard doesn’t understand why Penny is taking Sheldon’s side.
As Howard and Raj play video games, Raj says he’s worn out now he’s dating two women at once. Raj claims not to even remember the last time he slept in his own apartment. When Bernadette comes in the room, Raj asks how the mother-to-be is. Bernadette says she’s tired, prompting Raj to say he is too as he’s dating multiple women. Howard asks if she wants to join their Game of Thrones viewing party, but she says she’s just going to snuggle up in bed with a book.
Back in the apartment, Penny accuses Leonard of pouting, but he just wants to be left alone. Penny tells Leonard they know he’s going to make up with Sheldon, so why don’t they just skip ahead to that? Leonard says he is tired of feeling like the only adult around here. Penny says you would think the “only adult” wouldn’t let such a trivial matter ruin their evening, but Leonard says you would think she should know why he is feeling annoyed.
As Howard and Raj drive over to the apartment, Howard admits he doesn’t know whether he’s hoping for a boy or a girl. If it’s a boy, he’d have to learn how to play catch. If it’s a girl, they’re so innocent and you know how guys are. Raj knows guys are the worst, citing his relationships with Emily and Claire. After Howard says “there you go again”, Raj wonders if he’s been complaining his dating situation too much. Howard argues he’s just pretending to complain and is really just bragging.
When Amy wonders why Leonard is so angry, Penny and Sheldon explain he’s upset about having to attend the roommate meeting. After Amy says she gets why Leonard is annoyed, Sheldon tries to explain to her why she’s wrong. Amy knows how Leonard feels, saying she never enjoyed her relationship agreement meetings with Sheldon.
As Howard and Raj climb the stairs in silence, Raj wonders whether he said something to upset Howard. Howard insists he’s fine and wants Raj to drop it. Raj claims Howard is jealous of him dating two women. When they reach the fourth floor, Penny and Sheldon emerge from the apartment with half of the party sub. After Howard asks what’s going on, Penny says Leonard is being a jerk and they’re going to watch Game of Thrones in her apartment. When Amy invites Howard to join her and Leonard, he’s up for that as long as he doesn’t have to watch it with Raj. Raj decides to go with Sheldon and Penny.
Back in the apartment, Leonard tells Howard he ran out of patience with Sheldon’s nonsense. Howard admits he’s had enough of Raj, too. Amy points out that men have a monthly hormone cycle like women, which can cause irritability. When there’s a knock at the door, Leonard wonders if someone has come to apologize. He opens the door to find Stuart in a Game of Thrones-inspired costume. Stuart is surprised to find it’s not a dress-up party as Howard told him.
Stuart knocks on the door and enters Apartment 4B, explaining he was told that’s where to go if he’s mad at Howard. Sheldon catches Stuart up: Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at him and Penny, he’s angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and Sheldon’s angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for him to spoil for Leonard. Raj goes on to explain Howard is angry with him for talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, but he thinks Howard is just jealous of him. Stuart admits he is jealous is Raj.
In the apartment, Leonard thanks Amy for sticking up for him. Amy admits she couldn’t care less about their argument. She only took his side because she’s annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are. Leonard points out they argue all the time, but Amy says Penny is the one who comforts Sheldon when he’s upset and gets him to take his medicine when he’s sick. Amy reveals that Penny has Sheldon add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way without fighting Leonard about it. After Howard laughs, Leonard points out Bernadette does the same thing with him and Koothrappali.
Over in Penny’s apartment, the group sit down as Game of Thrones is about to start. After there’s a knock at the door, Penny opens it to Leonard, who tells her she doesn’t need to use Sheldon to get her way in the dumb roommate agreement. When Penny wonders where he got that from, Leonard admits it was Amy. Penny walks into the hall to ask why Amy revealed that. Amy comes out to say it’s because Penny always defends Sheldon. As they bicker about Sheldon and Penny’s relationship, Howard asks if there were any nuts in the food. When he walks into the hallway, his face is hideously swollen.
As the group sit around in a hospital waiting room, Leonard says he didn’t realize the Italian sub contained pistachios. Everyone is relieved when Bernadette comes out to say Howard is going to be okay. Raj claims tonight’s events were like a real life Game of Thrones, but the friends don’t find his examples very convincing. Howard comes out and says he’s fine, so they decide to get out of there.
As Stuart, still in his costume, gets on his bicycle outside the apartment building, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard yell insults at him from the apartment window.
Later that night, Sheldon knocks on Leonard’s bedroom door as he and Penny are sleeping. When Leonard asks what he wants, Sheldon says he never got to ask his question about Batman and Manbat."
922,"As they eat dinner in the apartment, Penny tells the group she won a night of wine tasting at work and asks if her friends are interested. Raj and Amy are up for it, but Sheldon doesn’t want wine again. Howard says they won’t be able to go as Bernie can’t drink, but she says he should go. Bernadette is less than enthusiastic when Sheldon suggests he and Bernadette spend the evening together instead. Now that she’s pregnant, Bernadette is avoiding many of the things he’s been avoiding his whole life. Bernadette relents and agrees to give it a try.
In Howard’s lab, Raj asks if he can bring Claire to the wine-tasting as he’s been wanting her to meet the guys. After Raj admits he’s still dating Emily, Leonard wonders how this works. Raj says they know they’re not exclusive, but they don’t ask too many questions. Sheldon likens this to his online gaming mates, Frank and Alicia. After Howard says they’re ready, the guys successfully test their guidance system.
In Raj’s apartment, he phones Claire to ask if she’s free Saturday night to attend a wine-tasting with his friends. Claire is free but she wonders whether meeting his friends is too big a step. Raj doesn’t think it’s a big deal, but Claire points out they’ve been keeping things casual. What if she meets his friends and they don’t like her or she doesn’t like them?
In the apartment, Leonard is using a scratch ‘n sniff wine-tasting book to prepare for the evening ahead. Before they leave, Penny asks Sheldon whether he is still hanging out with Bernadette tonight. Sheldon confirms they are and is happy to share the list of things he and Bernadette will be avoiding.
At the wine tasting, Howard and Amy are stuck for things to say when they are the first to arrive. They are relieved when Leonard, Penny and Raj finally show up. As Raj explains Claire is meeting them there, he begs his friends not to ask too many awkward questions about their relationship as they’re trying to keep it casual. When Amy sees Penny’s old ex-boyfriend, Zack, across the room, she asks if Penny’s going to go say hi to him. Penny isn’t sure about going over to see him.
When Bernadette arrives at the apartment, she tells Sheldon she’s brought sparkling cider. Sheldon details the fetus-friendly evening he has planned: an in-depth look at the world of model trains, followed by an exploration of the different ways to make toast. 
Leonard can’t smell anything as his friends discuss the notes they’re picking up from the wine. When Zack comes over to talk to the group, he notices Leonard and Penny are married. Apart from their time together, Zack admits he was always rooting for them two of them. When Zack asks what’s up in the science world, Howard explains they’ve been working on a navigation system. After Howard explains it can be put in satellites or rockets, Zack wonders whether it could be used for weapons or war stuff. Leonard doesn’t think the military would be interested in their little project. After they admit their system is much better than what the military use now, Zack wonders whether they really are smart.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon talks Bernadette through the different sizes of model train gauges. After she asks him what it is about trains that he likes so much, Sheldon admits that life was confusing and chaotic for him as a child, and trains represented order. He could line them up, categorize them and control them. Bernadette thinks that’s lovely.
Leonard and Howard admit they have both been worried about the military use of their system. Raj argues they can’t let this stop them as virtually any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes. When Claire turns up, Raj awkwardly introduces her as his friend he is casually dating.
Bernadette is bored as Sheldon describes the various types of toast, including something he calls “Star Wars toast”. Things get worse when Sheldon says it’s time for Dungeons and Dragons. Bernadette is not enthusiastic about playing the game, but Sheldon insists she will enjoy it as he designed it especially for her. Sheldon tells Bernadette her character is Bernatrix, a warrior queen who is strong, beautiful and tall. Bernadette likes the idea of being tall. Sheldon mentions there’s a lot she will like in this universe, including the fact it is the men who carry the babies.
At the wine-tasting, Amy tells Claire they’ve heard so many wonderful things about her, but she is thrown when Claire asks what. When Zack walks over to see them, Raj introduces Claire as his friend. Zack asks if she’s seeing anyone, so Raj points out she’s seeing him. Zack is confused why Raj described her as a friend, arguing she seems great and wondering why Raj is being casual with her.
As they use the men’s room, Leonard and Howard are still concerned about the potential military application of their guidance system. Leonard wonders whether they should take a step back with the guidance system, but Howard points out he needs more money with a child on the way. Leonard doesn’t see what use money is if they accidentally bring about armageddon. Howard can’t imagine their invention will be used to bring about the end of the world.
Back in the apartment, Bernadette is excited as Sheldon takes her through her final battle in the game of Dungeons and Dragons. Bernadette admits the night has been much more fun than she expected. She thanks Sheldon for the evening, admitting that ever since she got pregnant she feels like she became “pregnant Bernadette”. She says it was nice to take a break from that. Sheldon tells her that any time she needs a break from being pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen will be there waiting.
Raj goes over to Zack’s table to tell him that he’s killing him with Claire. Next to Zack, Raj doesn’t feel so hot. Raj wants Zack to do him a favor and stop talking about how great Claire is.
Back at the group’s table, Claire asks Penny if Raj brings around a lot of girls. Penny deflects the question to Amy, but Leonard jumps in to say Raj is a terrific guy and loyal to a fault. When Raj and Zack return to the table, Zack loudly says he sees what Raj is saying and Claire is not so great. After Raj asks what they were talking about, Claire says his friends were telling her about all the girls he’s dating. Raj is upset and asks why they would do that when he specifically asked them not to. His friends point out they didn’t reveal how many women he is dating, he just did. Zack wonders if any of them are smart.
The next morning, Leonard is feeling the effect of the night’s drinking when he goes to the kitchen where Sheldon is eating toast. When Leonard asks Sheldon if he ever thought about the military applications of their guidance system, Sheldon answers of course. It bothered him at first but he talked it through with his online friends, Frank and Alicia, and they helped put things into perspective."
923,"In the apartment, Sheldon is showing Penny flash cards containing scientific images while she shows him pictures of famous people. When Leonard gets up, Sheldon tells him that he and Penny decided to use their breakfast time to expand their respective knowledge bases. Leonard asks Penny if she wants to go with him to the airport later to pick up his mother. After Penny agrees, Leonard questions whether he needs to go as well. Leonard says he could do without the forty minute car ride where his mother criticizes every aspect of his life and suggests the car journey would be a good way for Penny to bond with Beverly. Penny thinks it’s just a way for him to avoid his mother, but she agrees anyway as she would like to have a good relationship with her mother-in-law.
In the comic book store, Raj tells the guys about a screening of the Avengers movie tonight where Joss Whedon will be doing a Q&A session. Raj explains it’s first-come-first-served, so they should get there early and wait in line. Howard and Leonard are in, but Sheldon says Amy is making him go shopping with her later. Sheldon is disappointed that his friends say they will be going to the screening without him. Leonard suggests he go shopping with Amy while they save a spot for him in line, but Sheldon points out they don’t have the authority to save places in the line. Howard mentions that there are apps now that allow you to pay people to do errands and wait in line. Stuart is surprised people are waiting in line as a job. It makes him feel better about his life, until he hears how much they can earn.
As Penny drives Beverly back from the airport, she admits she is not surprised her son had his wife come pick her up. Beverly claims Leonard has had intimacy issues his whole life and goes on to ask whether he has difficulty maintaining erections. Penny tries to change the subject, but Beverly argues she is a psychiatrist so Penny doesn’t need to avoid having intimate conversations with her. Penny admits she would like to be close, although she would rather start favorite books instead. Beverly recognises she can be intimidating, so she asks what she can do to make this easier for Penny. Penny wants her to not psychoanalyze everything she says. When Penny proposes a mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight, Beverly wonders if it would just be the two of them. Penny says she’ll invite a few girlfriends because hearing her say “the two of us” sent a chill down her spine.
After Stuart climbs into Amy’s car, he explains Sheldon paid him to go shopping with her. Amy is surprised Sheldon paid someone to get out of spending time with her, but Stuart argues it’s not like that as there’s a long line Sheldon would rather stand in. An annoyed Amy tells Stuart they will not be shopping together.
As the guys wait in line at the movie theater, they reminisce about all the times they’ve queued together. Sheldon is surprised when Stuart walks up and accuses him of being the most insensitive person he has ever met. Stuart asks Sheldon where he gets off sending him to shop with Amy. Sheldon is puzzled as Stuart was happy to do it when he hired him. Stuart admits he’s not upset with Sheldon, but Amy is and she hired him to let Sheldon have it.
When Amy and Bernadette join Beverly and Penny in her apartment, Amy is unloading on Beverly about Sheldon’s behavior. After Beverly finally gets a chance to speak, she remarks that Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind and it’s understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying. Beverly says she admires Amy’s resolve, calling her a remarkable woman. Over in the kitchen area, Penny wonders why she can’t bond with Beverly like that. Bernadette points out Amy is with Sheldon, whom Beverly loves like a son and Penny is with her son whom she doesn’t. When Penny takes snacks over to the couch, she remarks that being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges. Beverly’s only comment is “Well, what can you do?”.
When there is a knock on Penny’s door, Bernadette wonders if it’s Sheldon there to say sorry. When she opens the door to Stuart, he is holding a bouquet of flowers and tells them that Sheldon says he’s sorry. Amy offers Bernadette five dollars to slam the door in Stuart’s face.
Back at the theater, Raj is getting tired from all the standing around so he pulls out his collapsible stick chair. Howard thinks he looks like an idiot. When Stuart returns, Sheldon asks if everything is smoothed out with Amy. Stuart admits Amy is still pretty mad. Leonard wonders if it’s time for Sheldon to apologize for himself, but Sheldon fears he would lose his place in line. Stuart offers to stand in line for him, in return for more of his money.
Back in Penny’s apartment, Bernadette is trying to talk up Penny’s work to Beverly but instead sparks a conversation about her own career. Bernadette tries to get the subject back on to Penny, but all Penny has to talk about is her company car’s seat warmers. When Sheldon knocks at the door, Amy tells him to come in. Sheldon quickly says hello to everyone, explaining there’s a line that could start moving at any moment. Sheldon details the three basic steps of an apology and goes through them in rapid succession. Sheldon hopes Amy will accept his apology so he can get back to the Uber waiting outside. After Amy says fine, Sheldon quickly says his goodbyes and points out Penny has spinach in her teeth. Beverly reveals it’s been there since the airport.
As Stuart stands in for Sheldon at the theater, Howard is still mocking Raj for his stick chair. When Sheldon returns, he claims the apology went well and relieves Stuart of his line duties. Sheldon is upset when he sees a guy join the group in front of them in the line. Sheldon tells Leonard the guy cut the line, but Leonard thinks it’s fine as he was just joining his friends. Sheldon argues it’s a breach of line etiquette, but Howard points out they’re near the front of the line and will get in either way. Ignoring Leonard’s plea that he ignore it, Sheldon confronts the guy. The guy points out he was just joining his friends, so it’s cool. Sheldon disagrees, pointing out it’s first-come-first-served. When Sheldon tells the guy he needs to go to the back of the line, he wonders who whether Sheldon is for real.
Beverly tells Amy it was very nice of Sheldon to apologize, admitting she is fascinated by Amy’s relationship with Sheldon. Beverly mentions she is preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples and would like to interview the two of them. Amy mentions that Bernadette’s husband is a former astronaut. When Beverly asks if he might be interested in being interview, Bernadette admits she overhears Howard pretending to be interviewed in the bathroom. Bernadette suggests Beverly might want to talk to Penny as well, but Beverly doesn’t see why.
Having had enough of being ignored and belittled, Penny snaps and tells Beverly this is ridiculous. Penny says she’s been trying to make a connection with Beverly all day, but clearly she is getting nowhere. Beverly wonders whether Penny’s seeking a connection or just some form of validation. Penny argues she was seeking some form of friendship, but now she would take Beverly not insulting her to her face. When Beverly claims her intention was never to insult her, Penny says she’s been doing it all day and wonders if she even knows what an insult is. Beverly admits it’s not a clinical term, but one example would be Penny marrying her son and not telling her about the wedding.
Back at the theater, Sheldon and the guy argue about whether Joss Whedon would support line-cutters. Sheldon takes the debate to the public and asks for a show of hands: Who there takes issue with the man cutting the line? When nobody raises their hand, Sheldon argues it is a sad state of affairs that they don’t even care when someone disrespects them. Sheldon invokes the name of Rosa Parks and asks the crowd to follow in her footsteps and stand up for themselves. When he asks for another show of hands, a woman questions why they should listen to Sheldon when he cut the line himself. Sheldon denies that and argues what he did was swapsies, not cutsies. Sheldon’s protest fizzles out as the line starts moving.
Back in the apartment, Penny is surprised Beverly cared about the wedding at all. Beverly points out she is still human and not getting invited to her own son’s wedding is difficult to ignore. When Penny questions whether Beverly would have come to Vegas if they had invited her, Beverly says she wouldn’t have gone and would have told them they were making a huge mistake. After Penny asks if she really thinks they made a mistake, Beverly admits she did at the time, but she has never seen Leonard so happy so perhaps she was wrong. Penny proposes having another small ceremony while Beverly is still in town if she’s interested. Beverly says she would find that perfectly acceptable.
As Bernadette gets ready for bed, she checks on Howard who has been in the bathroom a while. Bernadette overhears him pretending to be interviewed about his career as an astronaut."

After Leonard asks how it went with his mother, Penny says it started a little rocky but they ended up in a good place. Penny mentions that she promised Beverly they would have another wedding ceremony which she could attend this time. After Penny says they can invite their friends and family this time, Leonard admits he would love it if his dad can come.
In the apartment, Penny tells Amy and Bernadette that it’s not a legal ceremony, just a chance for them to redo their vows. Sheldon comes to say he just got off the phone with his mother and she’s coming to the wedding. Bernadette thinks it’s sweet Penny is going to all this trouble for Beverly. Penny says she’s also doing it for Leonard, as she thinks this could really help his relationship with his mother.
As Leonard drives his mother from the airport, Beverly is furious that he invited his father without consulting her. Leonard argues he doesn’t need her permission to have his father at his wedding. Beverly reminds him that her marriage ended because his father cheated on her.
In his lab, Howard excitedly tells Raj that the quantum vortex is working. Raj is amazed that they have a working guidance system. Just as they celebrate, Howard receives an email from the U.S. Air Force to discuss the guidance system. Raj wonders whether there’s a window around there that they don’t know about, but Howard is sure it’s just a coincidence.
As Amy drives Sheldon and his mother from the airport, Mary thanks Amy for picking her up. Mary remarks that it was nice of Leonard and Penny to invite her, admitting she has a special place in her heart for Leonard for taking care of her son. When Mary asks who else is coming, Amy mentions Penny’s family is coming tomorrow and Sheldon explains Leonard’s mother is already here. Mary is less than thrilled to meet Beverly again, taking her cross necklace out from under her shirt.
In the apartment, Mary and Beverly sit from across from each other in stony silence. They break the quiet by engaging in unconvincing small talk. Over in the kitchen area, Penny and Amy comment on how chilly things are between the two mothers, forgetting they can hear them.
In Howard’s kitchen, he is freaking out about the military taking over their whole project. Bernadette tells him he’s overreacting, but Howard claims the military will erase him if he objects to their plan. Raj thinks the military is probably just looking to purchase the idea, but Howard argues that’s not how it works.
After Leonard walks with his father into the building, Alfred notices that the elevator is out of order. Alfred is fine taking the stairs, figuring he won’t need to see Beverly if he has a heart attack before he reaches the fourth floor. Leonard tells Alfred that even though things are rough between him and Beverly, he is really glad he’s there.
Up in the apartment, Sheldon, Amy and Penny are caught in the uncomfortable silence between Beverly and Mary. After Leonard arrives with Alfred, Penny thanks him for coming.

Leonard asks his parents not to start as he and Penny are throwing this wedding for their benefit. Penny mentions they have a dinner reservation soon.

As Leonard drives Penny and his mother to the restaurant, Beverly tells Penny she hopes that the example of her failed marriage won’t discourage her from the commitment she’s made to Leonard. When Penny says of course not, Beverly remarks that she and Alfred had a lot more going for them than they do.
As Amy drives Sheldon, Mary and Alfred to the restaurant, Mary asks Alfred what he does for a living. Alfred explains he is an anthropologist who studies ancient peoples and cultures. Alfred laughs when Mary mentions that’s “all the way back to the flood”. Sheldon explains she wasn’t not joking. Alfred says there are many cultures which have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology. Mary points out she doesn’t have a mythology, just the unerring word of God, but she thinks that’s very interesting. Alfred tells her he didn’t mean to disparage her faith, in fact he admires it. Alfred admits he’s agnostic himself, but he has prayed many times to God to turn his wife into a pillar of salt. The pair laugh as Mary says He came close and turned her into a giant block of ice.
As Howard drives Bernadette and Raj to the restaurant, Raj tells him there must be someone at the university he can turn to for help. Howard thinks they’re probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place. Howard fears he’s being harassed by the government, but Bernadette tells him all the movies and TV shows he’s watched have twisted his thinking. She tells him no one's after him, no one's listening to him, and no one cares about him.
When Leonard wonders whether the car in front is Howard’s, Penny tells him to get closer. Howard starts to fear somebody is following them, but Bernadette says he’s being ridiculous. Raj tells him to turn left and see if he turns with them. Leonard and Penny are puzzled when Howard turns away from the restaurant, but Leonard thinks he might have been guided by a traffic app to avoid an accident. Howard and Raj are fearful when the car turns with them. Bernadette thinks it’s a coincidence, but tells Howard to speed up a little and see if the car stays with them. As Howard pulls away, Penny urges Leonard to go faster and flash his lights so Howard knows it’s him. Raj is alarmed that the car behind wants them to pullover.

Alfred and Beverly start trading barbs as Mary tries to calm the situation with a quote from the bible. As the tension mounts, Alfred tells Leonard he’s feeling a tired and is going to call it a night. Mary says she is also tuckered out and will see everyone tomorrow. As Mary and Alfred leave together, they decide to share a cab to the hotel where they’re both staying. Leonard wonders what is happening on there.
Back in the apartment, Sheldon is puzzled that his mother is still not picking up the phone. Leonard’s father isn’t texting him back either.
