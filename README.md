## Knowledge-Based Video Question Answering with Unsupervised Scene Descriptions

This is the PyTorch implementation of our ROLL model. 

![roll](https://github.com/noagarcia/ROLL-VideoQA/blob/master/Images/model.png?raw=true)

ROLL consists on three branches, each performing a different inspired-cognitive task:
1) **Read branch**: Dialog comprehension.
2) **Observe branch**: Visual scene reasoning.
3) **Recall branch**: Storyline recalling. 

The information generated by each branch is encoded via Transformers. A modality weighting mechanism balances the output from the different modalities to predict the final answer.

### Dependencies

This code runs on Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.0.1. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install the dependencies.
```
conda create --name roll-videoqa python=3.6
conda activate roll-videoqa
conda install -c anaconda numpy pandas scikit-learn 
conda install -c conda-forge visdom tqdm
conda install pytorch==1.0.1 torchvision==0.2.2 -c pytorch
pip install pytorch-transformers
```
 * Dependencies: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [PyTorch 1.0.1](https://pytorch.org/), [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html), [PyTorch-Transformers](https://pypi.org/project/pytorch-transformers/), 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), and [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom).
* Optional: [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to download episode summaries (already provided).


### Data

For data preparation, follow instructions in [DATA.md](DATA.md).


### ROLL on KnowIT VQA

#### Training
To see the visualizations during training, first start Visdom in a terminal. Visualizations can be accessed at `http://localhost:8097`.
``` 
python -m visdom.server
```

To train ROLL on KnowIT VQA datset run:

```
bash train.sh knowit
```
The training is performed in two stages: 
1) First, all the three branches (read, observe, recall) are pretrained.
2) Then, the network that fuses the outputs from the branches is trained using the modality weighting mechanism.

#### Evaluation
